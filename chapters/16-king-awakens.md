# Chapter Sixteen: King Awakens

Dave, Buddy, and Arthur stepped into the Inner Sanctum to find themselves in a vast chamber dominated by a massive throne made of twisted metal and bone. Upon it sat a figure they had been seeking—the Zombie Doctor, but he looked different than expected.

Dr. Zomboss was not the mindless monster they had imagined, but a tragic figure. His once-human features were partially preserved, showing the brilliant scientist he had once been, now corrupted by the Death Spores that had transformed him.

"Welcome to my domain," Dr. Zomboss said, his voice carrying both intelligence and madness. "I suppose you're here to 'save the day,' as heroes always do."

Dave stepped forward, his hand not on his weapon but extended in a gesture of peace. "Dr. Zomboss... Edgar... we know what happened to you. The Death Spores, the accident—it wasn't your fault."

The Zombie Doctor's eyes flickered with something almost human. "You... you know my real name? How...?"

"We found the archives," Arthur explained. "We learned about your research, your dedication to helping plants and humans coexist. You were a good man, Edgar."

For a moment, Dr. Zomboss seemed to waver, but then his expression hardened. "Good man? I became this... this abomination! Everything I touched turned to corruption and death!"

"But it doesn't have to stay that way," Dave said gently. "We can help you. There's a way to break free from the Death Spores' influence."

"Impossible!" Dr. Zomboss roared, rising from his throne. "I've tried everything! There is no cure!"

"There is," Dave said, pulling out the formula they had discovered. "The Light of Life. But it requires something from you—the willingness to be saved."

The final confrontation was not a battle of weapons, but a battle for the Zombie Doctor's soul.
