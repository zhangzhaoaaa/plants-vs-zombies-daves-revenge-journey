# Chapter Five: Water Adventure

Moonlight flowed like water across the dock's wooden planks, casting an ethereal blue glow. Dave and Buddy stood at the dock's edge, gazing at the water before them. This was a strange lake with water black as ink, occasionally rippling with eerie green phosphorescence, as if something was writhing beneath the surface.

"According to the map, we must cross this water to reach the zombie kitchen," Dave frowned. "But I don't see any boats."

Buddy alertly sniffed the air, suddenly barked once, and ran toward the end of the dock. Dave followed Buddy and discovered a small wooden boat hidden in the reeds.

"Good eye, Buddy!" Dave patted Buddy's head. "Looks like we have transportation."

The wooden boat looked old but seemed still usable. Dave and Buddy carefully boarded the boat, and Dave picked up the oars, beginning to row toward the center of the lake.

"Stay alert, Buddy," Dave whispered. "I always feel there's something under this water."

Buddy lay at the bow, eyes vigilantly scanning the water surface. The lake at night was unusually calm, with only the sound of oars cutting through water breaking the silence.

They had been rowing for about ten minutes, and the lake surface remained calm. Dave began to relax his guard and even started humming a tune.

"Maybe I was too tense," Dave laughed to Buddy. "It looks like this lake isn't—"

Before he could finish his words, a huge splash suddenly erupted beside the boat, interrupting him. A zombie dressed in pirate costume leaped from the water and landed on their small boat!

"Ah! Pirate zombie!" Dave cried out, nearly falling into the water.

The pirate zombie wore tattered pirate clothing, had a tricorn hat on his head, an eyepatch over one eye, and held a rusty cutlass. It let out a low growl at Dave and Buddy, waving the cutlass.

Buddy bravely stood in front of Dave, barking loudly at the pirate zombie, trying to protect his master.

"Don't worry, Buddy, I have a way to deal with it!" Dave quickly took out a seed from his backpack—it was blue and shaped like a water drop.

"Squash!" Dave planted the seed in a small flower pot on the boat. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a blue plant shaped like a pistol, its barrel aimed at the pirate zombie. The Squash began spraying high-pressure water streams, hitting the pirate zombie and washing it overboard.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Squash is especially effective on water!"

But their victory was short-lived. More splashes erupted on the lake surface, and more and more pirate zombies leaped from the water—some landed on their boat, others swam in the water, surrounding their small vessel.

"We're surrounded!" Dave cried in terror. "We need more plant helpers!"

He quickly took out more Squash seeds from his backpack and planted them around the boat. The Squashes began spraying water streams in all directions, repelling some pirate zombies, but there were too many zombies for the Squashes to handle all the enemies.

Just then, the lake surface suddenly shook violently, and a huge pirate ship slowly rose from underwater! This ship was ten times larger than their small wooden boat, with a black hull, tattered sails, and a fierce zombie skull carved at the bow. The ship was filled with pirate zombies, led by a particularly tall zombie wearing ornate pirate captain attire and a large hat decorated with feathers.

"Ha ha ha! Welcome to the zombie pirates' domain!" the zombie captain laughed, his voice hoarse and piercing. "I am Captain Redbeard, ruler of these waters! You land creatures dare to trespass in my territory!"

Dave and Buddy looked in terror at this massive pirate ship. Their small wooden boat seemed so tiny beside the pirate ship, like a grain of sand next to a leaf.

"We're just passing through," Dave tried to explain. "We're going to the zombie kitchen."

"The zombie kitchen?" Captain Redbeard narrowed his eyes. "That's the Zombie King's territory! Without my permission, no one can cross these waters to reach there!"

"Then we need your permission," Dave said. "What can we do to earn it?"

Captain Redbeard thought for a moment, then showed a cunning smile: "I like games. If you can win in my challenge, I'll let you pass. But if you fail, you'll become permanent crew members on my ship!"

Dave and Buddy exchanged a glance. They had no choice but to accept the challenge.

"We accept," Dave said. "What's the challenge?"

"Pirate ship battle!" Captain Redbeard laughed loudly. "We'll give you a small ship and some weapons. You must sink my three escort ships, then battle my flagship! If you can defeat me, I'll let you pass!"

Following the captain's command, several pirate zombies lowered a slightly larger boat into the water and provided Dave and Buddy with some simple weapons—several swords and an old musket.

"These are useless," Dave whispered to Buddy. "We need our own weapons."

He took out several different seeds from his backpack, preparing to plant them on the new boat.

"The competition begins!" Captain Redbeard shouted, waving his cutlass.

Three small pirate ships separated from the main ship and sailed toward Dave and Buddy's boat. Each ship had five or six pirate zombies wielding weapons and making terrible roars.

"Prepare for battle, Buddy!" Dave said, quickly planting several seeds in different positions on the boat.

First, he planted several Squash seeds, which grew rapidly, forming the boat's front defensive line. Then he planted a special seed—it was green and spiral-shaped.

"Kelp!" Dave said. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a green aquatic plant shaped like a whirlpool. The Kelp began creating a water current vortex around the boat, making the boat more agile and able to turn and move quickly.

"Fantastic!" Dave cheered. "With Kelp, our boat can be as agile as a fish!"

The first pirate ship approached, with pirate zombies preparing to jump onto Dave's boat. But Dave quickly controlled the Kelp, making the boat turn rapidly and avoiding the pirate ship's collision. At the same time, the Squashes sprayed high-pressure water streams at the pirate ship, hitting several pirate zombies and washing them into the water.

"Attack their ship!" Dave shouted to the Squashes.

The Squashes adjusted their angles and began spraying water streams at the pirate ship's hull. The high-pressure streams penetrated the rotting wooden planks, and the pirate ship began taking on water, slowly sinking.

"One ship down!" Dave cheered. "Two more to go!"

But the other two pirate ships had already flanked from both sides, trying to pincer Dave's boat. Dave again controlled the Kelp, making the boat retreat quickly and avoiding the pincer attack.

"We need more firepower!" Dave said, taking out a new seed from his backpack—it was red and flame-shaped.

"Fire Flower!" Dave planted the seed in the center of the boat. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a red plant with flowers shaped like flames. The Fire Flower began shooting fireballs at the pirate ships, igniting their sails and wooden planks.

"Be careful not to burn our own boat!" Dave warned.

The Fire Flower seemed to understand Dave's words, adjusting the fireballs' trajectory to ensure they only hit the pirate ships. The two pirate ships were quickly consumed by flames, and the pirate zombies jumped into the water, trying to escape.

"All three ships defeated!" Dave cheered. "Now only Captain Redbeard's flagship remains!"

Captain Redbeard saw his three escort ships sunk, and his expression changed from contempt to anger.

"You cursed land creatures!" he roared. "I'll deal with you personally!"

His flagship began sailing toward Dave's boat, with all the pirate zombies on board ready with weapons, preparing for a fierce battle.

"This is trouble," Dave said worriedly. "Their ship is too big; our plants might not be able to fight it."

Buddy suddenly barked once, pointing at the water surface. Dave followed Buddy's gaze and saw a huge dark shadow moving underwater.

"What's that?" Dave asked in surprise.

Just then, the water surface suddenly exploded, and a huge creature leaped from the water—it was a massive seaweed with long tentacles and a large mouth, looking like a combination of a giant Venus flytrap and an octopus.

"Sea monster!" Captain Redbeard cried in terror. "Everyone, prepare for battle!"

The sea monster's tentacles began attacking Captain Redbeard's flagship, wrapping around the hull and trying to drag the ship underwater. The pirate zombies frantically waved their weapons, trying to cut the tentacles, but the sea monster had too many tentacles and they were too strong.

"This is our chance!" Dave said to Buddy. "While they're entangled with the sea monster, we can escape!"

But Buddy didn't move. Instead, he stared at the sea monster, seeming to think about something. Then Buddy suddenly jumped to the bow and barked loudly at the sea monster—not threatening barks, but strange, rhythmic barks, as if communicating with the sea monster.

To Dave's surprise, the sea monster seemed to respond to Buddy's barking, making low, rhythmic sounds. Then some of the sea monster's tentacles released Captain Redbeard's flagship and reached toward Dave's boat instead.

"Buddy, be careful!" Dave warned, preparing to use plants to protect their boat.

But Buddy signaled Dave not to worry. The sea monster's tentacles gently wrapped around Dave's boat, but didn't attack. Instead, they began pulling the boat away from Captain Redbeard's flagship, toward the other end of the lake.

"Buddy, you're communicating with the sea monster?" Dave asked in amazement.

Buddy proudly barked once, seeming to say "yes."

"Amazing!" Dave marveled. "How did you do that?"

Buddy just wagged his tail without explaining.

The sea monster pulled Dave's boat at amazing speed, quickly distancing them from Captain Redbeard's flagship. Captain Redbeard roared in the distance, waving his cutlass, but his ship was entangled by the sea monster's other tentacles and couldn't pursue.

"We won!" Dave cheered. "Thanks to you, Buddy, and our new friend the sea monster!"

The sea monster continued pulling their boat across the lake, finally reaching the other end. There was a small dock leading to a huge building—the zombie kitchen.

As their boat approached the dock, the sea monster gently released its tentacles and sank back into the water. Dave and Buddy waved goodbye to the sea monster, then stepped onto the dock.

"Thank you, sea monster friend!" Dave called out. "Hope to see you again someday!"

The water surface rippled, as if the sea monster was responding.

Dave and Buddy stood on the dock, looking at the building before them. The zombie kitchen was a huge, ancient building with gray stone walls, windows glowing green, several chimneys on the roof emitting green smoke. The entrance was a massive wooden door carved with various food and cooking utensil patterns, but all the food had zombie characteristics—apples with teeth, bread with eyes, cakes with arms.

"We've finally reached the zombie kitchen," Dave took a deep breath. "Our real challenges are just beginning now."

Buddy stood firmly beside Dave, ready to face any challenge.

"But first, we need to find a way to enter," Dave said, studying the door. "It looks like there are some strange symbols and puzzles on the door."

The door indeed had some strange symbols arranged in a complex pattern, seeming to be a puzzle or code.

"Looks like we need to solve this puzzle to enter," Dave said. "This will be our next challenge."

The sun began to rise, and a new day started. Dave and Buddy stood before the zombie kitchen's entrance, ready to face the greatest challenge of their journey.
