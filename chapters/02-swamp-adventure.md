# Chapter Two: Swamp Adventure

The morning sunlight filtered through gaps in the leaves, shining on Dave and Buddy's tent. Dave rubbed his eyes, crawled out of the tent, and stretched.

"Good morning, my plant friends!" Dave greeted the peashooters who had stood guard through the night. These little green warriors looked energetic and nodded to Dave.

Buddy also ran out of the tent, wagging its tail, seemingly eager to continue the adventure.

"Alright, guys," Dave said while packing up the tent, "today we need to cross the mysterious forest. According to the map, there's a swamp area ahead."

The peashooters automatically shrank back to seed form. Dave carefully put them back in his backpack, then he and Buddy began their new day's journey.

The air in the forest was fresh and humid, with various strange plants growing around them. Some looked almost... conscious, their leaves turning toward Dave and Buddy as they passed.

"Look at that, Buddy!" Dave pointed to a giant purple flower with strange spots on its petals that looked like eyes. When they approached, the flower suddenly "blinked" and then quickly closed up.

"These plants are amazing!" Dave said excitedly. "I've never seen varieties like these!"

Buddy didn't seem to share Dave's enthusiasm. It watched the surroundings alertly, occasionally letting out low growls.

As they went deeper into the forest, the ground became increasingly soft and wet. Soon, their ankles were sinking into the mud.

"I think we've reached the swamp area," Dave said, checking his map. "We need to cross this swamp to reach the entrance to the mysterious kitchen."

The swamp looked ominous and terrifying, with bubbling mud pits and twisted trees everywhere. The air was filled with a strange smell, like a mixture of rotting vegetables and some kind of chemicals.

"Stay alert, Buddy," Dave whispered. "This place gives me a bad feeling."

They carefully advanced through the swamp, trying to walk on ground that looked relatively solid. Suddenly, Buddy stopped and pricked up its ears.

"What's wrong, buddy?" Dave asked.

Just then, a strange "ribbit" sound came from a nearby mud pit. Ripples appeared on the water surface, then a huge creature jumped out and landed on a rock in front of them.

It was a frog, but not an ordinary frog. Its skin was grayish-green, its eyes glowed red, just like those zombie bats. More disturbing, its back was covered with strange purple bumps that looked like some kind of parasite.

"Zombie frog!" Dave exclaimed. "Be careful, Buddy!"

The zombie frog let out a piercing "ribbit," then jumped fiercely toward them. Dave and Buddy quickly dodged to one side; the frog landed where they had just been standing, splashing mud and water everywhere.

"We need plant helpers!" Dave took out a peashooter seed from his backpack and quickly planted it on a relatively dry patch of ground nearby.

The peashooter grew rapidly and began firing peas at the zombie frog. But the frog jumped agilely, dodging most of the attacks.

"It's too fast!" Dave said worriedly.

Just then, more "ribbit" sounds came from all directions. Dave looked around and saw at least five or six zombie frogs jumping out of mud pits, approaching them.

"We're surrounded!" Dave hurriedly planted several more peashooter seeds, but the frogs jumped too fast for the peashooters' attacks to hit them easily.

A particularly large zombie frog jumped in front of Dave, opening its mouth full of sharp teeth. Dave backed away in terror, but slipped and fell on the muddy ground.

"Ah!" Dave raised his arms, trying to protect himself.

Just as the zombie frog was about to pounce on Dave, a brown figure flashed by like lightning. It was Buddy! It bravely lunged at the zombie frog, biting one of the frog's hind legs with its teeth.

The zombie frog let out a painful scream, jumping wildly, trying to shake off Buddy. But Buddy held on tightly, simultaneously clawing at the frog's body with its paws.

"Buddy! Be careful!" Dave got up, wanting to help his companion.

Buddy successfully dragged the zombie frog to one side, buying Dave time. Dave quickly took out a new seed from his backpack—this time it was a snow pea seed.

"Grow, my friend!" Dave placed the seed on the ground.

The snow pea grew rapidly. It looked like an ordinary peashooter, but was ice-blue in color. It began firing frozen peas, each carrying a chill. When these frozen peas hit the zombie frogs, the frogs' movements noticeably slowed down.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Frozen peas can slow down their speed!"

Buddy successfully jumped away from the large zombie frog and returned to Dave's side. Its fur was covered with mud, but it didn't appear to be injured.

Dave planted several more snow peas, and they fired together, forming a blue defensive line. After being hit by frozen peas, the zombie frogs became sluggish, making perfect targets for the regular peashooters.

"We did it, Buddy!" Dave patted Buddy's head. "You were so brave!"

Buddy proudly wagged its tail, but suddenly its ears pricked up again.

"What now?" Dave looked around alertly.

This time, he heard a different sound—"buzzing," and it was getting closer.

"What's that?" Dave looked up, his face turning pale.

In the sky, a swarm of giant bees was flying toward them. Like the zombie frogs, these bees also had grayish-green bodies and glowing red eyes. Their tails had unusually large stingers that looked very dangerous.

"Zombie bees!" Dave exclaimed. "We need more plant helpers!"

The zombie bees dove down and began circling overhead. The peashooters tried to attack them, but the bees flew too high for most peas to reach them.

"We need plants that can attack aerial targets!" Dave frantically searched through his backpack. "Aha! Found it!"

He took out a new seed, larger than the others and darker in color.

"This is my newest cultivated variety—the Cactus!" Dave placed the seed on the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a tall cactus. Its body was covered with spikes, and it had a small mouth at the top.

"Attack those bees!" Dave commanded.

The Cactus nodded, then began shooting spikes from its body. These spikes flew like arrows toward the zombie bees in the air, accurately hitting several. The hit bees made piercing buzzing sounds and flew away unsteadily.

"Fantastic!" Dave cheered. "Let's have a few more!"

He planted several more Cactus seeds, and soon a row of Cacti formed a defensive line, shooting spikes at the zombie bees in the air.

But there were too many zombie bees. Even with the Cacti's help, Dave and Buddy were at a disadvantage. A particularly large zombie bee—possibly the queen—commanded the other bees to form a circle, surrounding Dave and Buddy.

"We're trapped!" Dave said worriedly. "We need a breakthrough!"

At this critical moment, Buddy suddenly ran to one side and began frantically digging at the swamp ground with its claws.

"Buddy? What are you doing?" Dave asked puzzledly.

Buddy didn't stop, continuing to dig. Soon, a water flow gushed out from the hole it had dug.

"Wait... that's..." Dave suddenly understood Buddy's intention. "It's groundwater! Buddy, you're a genius!"

The water flow grew larger, forming a small fountain. Dave quickly took out an aquatic plant seed from his backpack—a Lily Pad.

"Grow, my friend!" Dave placed the seed next to the water flow.

The Lily Pad grew rapidly. It had beautiful pink flowers with a small mouth in the center. It began firing water bullets at the zombie bees in the air. When these water bullets hit the bees, their wings became soaking wet and they couldn't fly normally.

"Excellent!" Dave planted several more Lily Pad seeds. "Buddy, you're so smart!"

Buddy proudly wagged its tail, continuing to dig to let more groundwater flow out.

The Lily Pads and Cacti attacked together, quickly repelling most of the zombie bees. The queen bee, seeing things going badly, let out a piercing buzz and led the remaining bees in retreat.

"We succeeded!" Dave cheered, picking up Buddy and spinning around. "Thanks to you, my brave companion!"

Buddy happily licked Dave's face, then jumped down, wagging its tail.

Dave looked around and saw that both the zombie frogs and bees had retreated; the swamp had returned to calm. But he noticed that on the other side of the swamp, there was a path leading to a strange building—it looked like a giant... garden?

"Looks like we've found our next destination," Dave pointed in that direction. "That seems to be a garden maze. According to the map, we need to go through there to reach the mysterious kitchen."

Buddy nodded, seeming ready to face new challenges.

Dave collected some Lily Pad and Cactus seeds and put them back in his backpack. "These new friends will help us in future adventures," he told Buddy. "Now, let's continue forward!"

They left the swamp area and walked toward the mysterious garden maze. The sun had risen to its zenith, illuminating their path forward. But in the depths of the swamp behind them, a pair of glowing red eyes coldly watched them, then silently sank into the mud pit...
