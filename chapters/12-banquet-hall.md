# Chapter Twelve: Banquet Hall

When Dave, Buddy, and Arthur pushed open the doors to the Banquet Hall, the sight before them left them stunned. This didn't look like a terrifying zombie lair at all, but rather like a luxurious ballroom.

Massive crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling, emanating eerie green light. The hall's floor was covered with black and white marble tiles, and ancient oil paintings hung on the surrounding walls—the figures in the paintings seemed to follow them with their eyes. Most shocking of all, hundreds of zombies were dancing wildly in the center of the hall!

"What... what's going on?" Dave asked in surprise.

These zombies were completely different from any they had encountered before. They wore gorgeous tailcoats and evening gowns, their hair was neatly combed, and they even wore sparkling jewelry. They danced gracefully to the music, moving as elegantly as real nobles.

"These are Dancing Zombies," Arthur explained. "They're special zombies created by the Zombie Doctor specifically to deceive intruders. Don't be fooled by their appearance—they're equally dangerous."

The music came from a massive pipe organ at the other end of the hall. A zombie in a black tailcoat was playing, its fingers dancing across the keys, producing an eerie yet beautiful melody.

"Woof woof!" Buddy growled alertly, sensing the dangerous aura emanating from these zombies.

Just then, the music suddenly stopped. All the Dancing Zombies stopped moving and turned toward the doorway in unison, staring at Dave and his companions with their hollow eyes.

"Welcome, welcome!" The zombie playing the pipe organ stood up and bowed elegantly. "I am the conductor here, Zombie Mozart. Welcome to our eternal ball!"

Zombie Mozart's voice sounded magnetic, but it concealed disturbing evil. He wore an elaborate wig and refined makeup, but his rotting skin and hollow eyes revealed his true identity.

"We're not here to attend a ball," Dave said bravely. "We're looking for the Zombie Doctor!"

"Oh, how regrettable," Zombie Mozart made an exaggerated sad expression. "But anyone who wishes to pass through here must first attend our ball. Those are the rules."

He snapped his fingers, and all the Dancing Zombies immediately began surrounding Dave and his group. Their movements remained elegant, but dangerous light flickered in their eyes.

"Looks like we have no choice," Arthur gripped his magic staff. "Prepare for battle!"

"Wait," Dave suddenly had an idea. "Since they love music and dancing, let's use music against them!"

He took out several special seeds from his backpack—these were musical plant seeds he had collected in previous adventures.

"Musical plants?" Arthur said in surprise. "I thought these were extinct!"

Dave quickly planted the first seed. The seed sprouted and grew rapidly, becoming a unique plant—the Drum Flower. This plant's blossom looked like a drum and could produce powerful drumbeats.

"Boom boom boom!" The Drum Flower began playing, producing heart-stirring drum beats.

Hearing this rhythm, the Dancing Zombies immediately began swaying involuntarily to the beat. They seemed unable to resist the music's charm.

"It works!" Dave said excitedly. "Keep going!"

He planted several more different musical plant seeds:

Trumpet Flower: Blossoms shaped like trumpets, capable of playing bright melodies.

Piano Grass: Leaves like piano keys, capable of playing beautiful chords.

Violin Vine: Vines like violin strings, capable of playing graceful melodies.

Soon, the hall echoed with a plant concert. Dave's musical plants performed a lively and powerful march, with strong and infectious rhythms.

The Dancing Zombies were completely controlled by this music. They began dancing to Dave's music instead of following Zombie Mozart's direction.

"No! Impossible!" Zombie Mozart roared angrily. "My music is the most perfect!"

He frantically played the pipe organ, trying to regain control over the Dancing Zombies. The two types of music clashed violently in the hall, creating a musical battle.

"We need stronger musical power," Dave said. "Arthur, do you have any suggestions?"

Arthur thought for a moment. "I remember there's a special recipe in the Recipe Room—Harmony Potion. It can make all musical plants coordinate perfectly and unleash their maximum power."

"Then let's make it!" Dave said.

Arthur took out materials for making Harmony Potion from his backpack: note flower petals, rhythm fruit juice, and melody grass essence. He quickly mixed a potion radiating rainbow light.

"Give each musical plant one drop," Arthur said.

Dave used his Magical Seed Launcher to spray Harmony Potion on each musical plant. Instantly, all the musical plants began glowing, and their music became more harmonious and unified.

Now the music played by the plants was so beautiful that even Dave and Arthur couldn't help wanting to sway to the rhythm. The Dancing Zombies were completely immersed in this music, dancing faster and more frantically.

"Woof woof!" Buddy suddenly barked—he had discovered something important.

Buddy pointed toward the frantically dancing zombies. Dave observed carefully and found that these zombies were dancing too vigorously, causing problems with their bodies—their joints began loosening, decorations started falling off, and some zombies' wigs even flew away.

"They're dancing too wildly!" Dave said in surprise. "At this rate, they'll fall apart!"

Indeed, as the music became more intense, the Dancing Zombies began "falling apart" one by one. Their arms, legs, and heads all detached due to excessive dancing, finally becoming piles of bones and rags.

"No! My dance troupe!" Zombie Mozart cried out in despair.

But he himself couldn't resist this powerful musical charm either. He began swaying involuntarily to the beat, his fingers pressing randomly on the organ keys, producing harsh noise.

"Now's the time," Dave said. "Let's give him a special 'performance'!"

He took out a special potion from his backpack—the "Elemental Fusion Potion" he had made earlier. He sprayed the potion onto the Trumpet Flower.

The Trumpet Flower immediately began glowing, its blossom became enormous, radiating the light of fire, ice, lightning, and earth elements. Then it played a note that shook heaven and earth.

This note was so powerful that the entire hall began shaking. Zombie Mozart was struck by this mighty sound wave, his body began disintegrating, his gorgeous costume turned to fragments, and his elaborate wig flew toward the sky.

"This cannot be... my music... is perfect..." Zombie Mozart groaned desperately as he disintegrated.

Finally, he completely vanished, leaving only a pile of ash and scattered sheet music.

With Zombie Mozart's disappearance, the eerie atmosphere in the hall also dissipated. The crystal chandeliers stopped flickering, and the oil paintings on the walls returned to normal.

"We did it!" Dave said excitedly.

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked happily, spinning around Dave.

"But this is just the beginning," Arthur reminded them. "The Zombie Doctor is still waiting for us."

Just then, the wall at the other end of the hall suddenly opened, revealing a downward staircase. The stairs were deep, with no visible bottom, but a cold aura emanated from within.

"That should be the path to the underground warehouse," Arthur said. "From my memory, the Zombie Doctor's laboratory is deep underground."

"Then let's go down," Dave said firmly.

But just as they were preparing to leave, Dave noticed sheet music scattered on the ground. He picked up one piece and found strange symbols written on it.

"What's this?" Dave asked.

Arthur examined it carefully. "These are ancient plant magic runes. They look like part of some spell."

"Maybe it'll be useful to us," Dave said, putting the sheet music in his backpack.

They gathered their equipment, preparing for the next challenge. The musical plants had completed their task and began withering away, but Dave carefully collected the seeds they left behind for future use.

"Ready?" Dave asked his companions.

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked bravely.

"Ready when you are," Arthur gripped his magic staff.

They stepped onto the stairs leading underground. The stairs were steep, and the deeper they went, the darker it became. Occasionally, some glowing moss on the walls provided weak illumination, but most of the time they had to rely on the light from Arthur's magic staff to see their way.

"Watch your step," Arthur warned. "These stairs are old and might not be very stable."

Indeed, some stone steps had begun loosening, and they had to tread carefully. Buddy used his agility to scout ahead, occasionally barking "woof woof" to warn those behind of dangers.

After walking for about ten minutes, they finally reached the bottom of the stairs. Here was a huge underground space filled with mountains of boxes and cargo.

"This is the underground warehouse," Arthur said. "The Zombie Doctor stores large amounts of experimental materials and weapons here. We must be careful—there might be many traps."

"And," Dave added, "based on our previous experience, these boxes might be hiding zombies."

"Woof woof!" Buddy suddenly barked alertly—his nose had detected something suspicious.

Just then, a nearby box suddenly opened, and a zombie jumped out! But this zombie looked very strange—its entire body was made of cardboard, like a cardboard box.

"Box Zombie!" Arthur exclaimed. "They can perfectly disguise themselves as ordinary boxes!"

With the first Box Zombie's appearance, many surrounding boxes also began "coming to life." They unfolded one by one, revealing the zombies hidden inside. Some of these zombies were made of cardboard, others of wood, and still others of metal, but they all shared one trait—the ability to perfectly disguise themselves as harmless storage boxes.

"Looks like we have another tough battle ahead," Dave said, raising his Magical Seed Launcher.

"This time let's try new tactics," Arthur suggested. "We need to find a way to identify which are real boxes and which are disguised zombies."

Dave thought for a moment. "Buddy has a keen nose—maybe he can help us distinguish."

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked in agreement, already beginning to sniff around the warehouse, searching for real threats.

A new adventure was about to unfold in this trap-filled underground warehouse. Dave, Buddy, and Arthur would need to use their wisdom and courage to navigate this dangerous maze and continue their journey to find the Zombie Doctor.

And in the depths of the warehouse, even greater challenges awaited them...
