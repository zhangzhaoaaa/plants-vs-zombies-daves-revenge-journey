# Chapter Six: Kitchen Entrance Puzzle

The morning sun shone on the outer walls of the zombie kitchen, making the sinister building look less frightening. Dave and Buddy stood before the massive wooden door, studying the complex symbols and patterns on it.

"These symbols look like some kind of puzzle," Dave said, carefully observing the patterns on the door. "We need to solve it to get in."

The door's patterns consisted of various foods and kitchen utensils, but all with zombie characteristics—apples with teeth, bread with eyes, cakes with arms. These patterns were arranged around a central design featuring a large pot with some green liquid bubbling inside.

"It looks like a recipe," Dave thought. "Maybe we need to arrange these ingredients in the correct order?"

Just then, a small window on the door suddenly opened, and a zombie's face appeared. This zombie was different from the ones they had encountered before. It wore a tall chef's hat and had a small mustache, looking like a chef.

"Welcome to the zombie kitchen!" the zombie chef said in a hoarse but surprisingly clear voice. "I'm Pierre, the head chef of the zombie kitchen. If you want to enter, you must pass my culinary puzzle challenge!"

"Culinary puzzle?" Dave asked.

"Yes!" Pierre said excitedly. "The zombie kitchen only welcomes guests who truly understand cuisine. You must solve three food-related puzzles to earn the right to enter. Are you ready?"

Dave and Buddy exchanged glances. They had no choice but to accept the challenge.

"We're ready," Dave said. "Please give us the puzzles."

"Excellent!" Pierre laughed, revealing yellowed teeth. "First puzzle: I have skin but no meat, have seeds but can't be planted, can be eaten but taste terrible. What am I?"

Dave thought for a moment, then turned to Buddy: "This is a riddle about food. Has skin but no meat, has seeds but can't be planted... what could it be?"

Buddy tilted his head, seeming to think as well. Suddenly, he barked and ran to the door, using his paw to point at a pattern on the door—a watermelon.

"Watermelon?" Dave said in surprise. "But watermelons taste good, which doesn't fit the 'taste terrible' condition."

Buddy shook his head and pointed to another pattern—a lemon.

"Lemon!" Dave suddenly understood. "Lemons have skin but no meat inside, have seeds but can't directly grow lemon trees, and they certainly taste terrible when eaten directly! The answer is lemon!"

"Correct!" Pierre said in surprise. "You're smarter than I thought. Now, the second puzzle: I go from small to big, from big to small, but never move. I can make you full, and I can make you hungry. What am I?"

This riddle was harder. Dave and Buddy carefully considered each clue.

"From small to big, from big to small..." Dave muttered. "What food could it be?"

Buddy seemed to have an idea. He ran to Dave's backpack and nuzzled it with his nose.

"What are you trying to say, Buddy?" Dave asked. "Is the answer in the backpack?"

Buddy nodded, and Dave opened his backpack, searching through the items inside. Suddenly, his hand touched a small hourglass, a tool he used to time plant growth.

"Hourglass?" Dave said in surprise. "An hourglass gets smaller from top to bottom, bigger from bottom to top, but it doesn't move... wait, that's not food."

Buddy shook his head and pointed to a small bag in the backpack—Dave's dried provisions containing bread.

"Bread?" Dave thought. "Bread goes from small to big... because of fermentation? From big to small because it gets eaten? Can make you full, and can make you hungry... if you don't have bread, you'll go hungry! The answer is bread!"

"Wrong!" Pierre laughed loudly. "Think again!"

Dave scratched his head and continued thinking. Buddy pointed to another item in the backpack—a small clock.

"Clock? Time?" Dave suddenly understood. "Time! Time goes from small hours to big hours, then from big hours to small hours, but time itself doesn't move; time can make you full because as time passes you'll eat meals; it can also make you hungry because if you don't eat for a long time, you'll be hungry! The answer is time!"

"Correct!" Pierre said in amazement. "You really are clever! The last puzzle, and the hardest: I have a head but no brain, have feet but can't walk, have skin but can't be peeled. I grow in darkness but fear the dark. What am I?"

This riddle was indeed difficult. Dave and Buddy carefully analyzed each clue.

"Has a head but no brain, has feet but can't walk, has skin but can't be peeled..." Dave repeated. "Grows in darkness but fears the dark... this is so contradictory."

Buddy seemed confused too, pacing back and forth in front of the door. Suddenly he stopped and sniffed at the door crack. A faint smell drifted out from the crack—the scent of garlic.

"Garlic?" Dave thought. "Garlic has a head... no brain... has roots like feet but can't walk... has skin... grows in the darkness of soil but fears direct sunlight which would spoil it... the answer is garlic!"

"Correct!" Pierre exclaimed in amazement. "You've passed my puzzle challenge! As a reward, I will allow you to enter the zombie kitchen. But be careful, the dangers inside are far more terrifying than my puzzles!"

With Pierre's words, the door made a heavy clicking sound and slowly opened. A mixture of various smells rushed out—the fragrance of spices, the aroma of food, but also a strange, rotting smell that reminded Dave and Buddy that this was, after all, zombie territory.

"We did it, Buddy!" Dave said joyfully. "Thanks to your help!"

Buddy proudly wagged his tail, but his eyes remained alert, watching the open door, seeming to remind Dave that the real challenge was just beginning.

They carefully stepped into the zombie kitchen. Behind the door was a spacious front hall with strange kitchen utensils and food pictures hanging on the walls. The floor was black and white checkered tiles, and several dim lamps hanging from the ceiling cast green light. At the far end of the hall were three doors labeled "Seasoning Room," "Main Kitchen," and "Storage Room."

"It looks like we need to choose a path," Dave said, studying the three doors. "But which path is safe?"

Just then, Pierre's voice came from a speaker: "Welcome to the zombie kitchen's front hall! As a reward for passing the puzzles, I'll give you a hint: not all paths lead to the kitchen's core, some will only make you lost. Choose the right path and you'll advance; choose the wrong path and you'll regret it. Good luck!"

Dave and Buddy looked at each other, unsure which door to choose.

"We need more information," Dave said. "Let's carefully observe this front hall, maybe there are clues."

They began to carefully examine every corner of the front hall. Dave noticed that the food pictures on the walls seemed to tell a story—from raw materials to finished products, showing the food processing cycle. Meanwhile, Buddy discovered that the floor tiles weren't randomly arranged but formed a hidden pattern.

"Look here, Buddy!" Dave pointed to a series of pictures on the wall. "These pictures are telling a story. First are the raw materials—vegetables, meat, spices; then processing—cutting, mixing, seasoning; finally cooking—boiling, stir-frying, roasting. This is the complete food processing cycle!"

Buddy barked once, drawing Dave's attention to the tile pattern on the floor.

"What did you find, Buddy?" Dave crouched down to carefully observe the floor. "These tiles... form an arrow shape! The arrow points to... the Seasoning Room!"

But just then, Dave noticed that in the wall pictures, the seasoning process took place in the main kitchen, not in the seasoning room.

"Wait, this is a bit strange," Dave thought. "The arrow on the floor points to the Seasoning Room, but the pictures on the wall show that seasoning happens in the Main Kitchen. This is a contradiction."

Buddy seemed to notice this too, watching the three doors alertly and growling softly.

"I think this might be a trap," Dave said. "Pierre said not all paths lead to the kitchen's core, some will only make us lost. Maybe the arrow on the floor is deliberately misleading us!"

They continued searching for more clues. Dave noticed a small table in a corner of the front hall with a book on it. He walked over and found it was a recipe book titled "Zombie Gourmet Guide."

"Maybe this book has clues," Dave said, opening the pages.

The book was full of strange recipes like "Brain Soup," "Eyeball Salad," and "Finger Cookies" (literally fingers). But on the last page of the book, Dave found a strange passage:

"The true culinary journey begins with storage, for without good ingredients, there can be no good cooking."

"Storage Room!" Dave suddenly understood. "The answer is the Storage Room! The first step in food processing is preparing ingredients, and ingredients are stored in the storage room! Both the arrow on the floor and the pictures on the wall are misleading!"

Buddy seemed to agree with Dave's reasoning and ran to the Storage Room door, looking at Dave expectantly.

"Alright, we choose the Storage Room," Dave took a deep breath. "I hope this is the right choice."

They pushed open the Storage Room door and went in. Behind the door was a long, narrow corridor with tall shelves on both sides filled with various ingredients and seasonings. At the end of the corridor was another door marked "Main Kitchen."

"Looks like we chose correctly!" Dave said joyfully. "This path really does lead to the kitchen's core!"

But just as they were about to cross the corridor, some jars on the shelves suddenly came to life! Small zombies jumped out of the jars, wearing chef's uniforms and wielding various kitchen utensils as weapons.

"Seasoning zombies!" Dave exclaimed. "It seems passing the puzzles was just the first step—we still need to face these guards!"

The seasoning zombies held cleavers, rolling pins, and spatulas, advancing toward Dave and Buddy. Though small in size, they were numerous, and their weapons looked quite sharp.

"We need plant helpers!" Dave quickly took out several seeds from his backpack. "Prepare for battle, Buddy!"

He planted several peashooter seeds, which quickly grew and began firing peas at the seasoning zombies. But the seasoning zombies were very agile, using pot lids to block most of the peas and continuing to advance.

"These guys are much smarter than ordinary zombies!" Dave said worriedly. "We need a new strategy!"

Buddy suddenly ran to a shelf and pointed with his paw at a jar on it. Dave saw it was a jar of chili powder.

"Chili powder?" Dave thought. "Right! I have jalapeño seeds!"

He quickly took out a red seed from his backpack and planted it in the ground. The seed rapidly sprouted, grew, and became a red plant shaped like a chili pepper. The jalapeño began shooting flames, penetrating directly through the seasoning zombies' pot lid defenses and burning them to ash.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Jalapeños are very effective against these seasoning zombies!"

He planted several more jalapeño seeds and soon cleared most of the seasoning zombies. But just when they thought victory was at hand, the door at the end of the corridor opened, and a massive figure emerged—a tall zombie wearing a white chef's coat, with a tall chef's hat on its head and holding a huge meat cleaver.

"Head Chef Zombie!" Dave exclaimed. "Looks like we've disturbed the kitchen's master!"

The Head Chef Zombie let out a deep roar, raised its meat cleaver, and charged at Dave and Buddy. Its size was twice that of ordinary zombies, yet it moved surprisingly fast.

"We need more powerful plants!" Dave said, taking out a special seed from his backpack—this one was golden and larger than ordinary seeds.

"This is one of my most precious seeds—the Golden Peashooter!" Dave planted the seed in the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed rapidly sprouted and grew into a golden peashooter, twice the size of ordinary peashooters and shining with golden light. The Golden Peashooter began firing golden peas, each three times larger than ordinary peas and much more powerful.

The Head Chef Zombie tried to block the golden peas with its meat cleaver, but the peas' power was too strong, directly knocking the cleaver away. Having lost its weapon, the Head Chef Zombie became panicked, and the Golden Peashooter seized the opportunity, firing several golden peas in succession and knocking the Head Chef Zombie to the ground.

"We won!" Dave cheered. "The Golden Peashooter is so powerful!"

The Head Chef Zombie lay on the ground, motionless. Dave and Buddy carefully approached and confirmed it had been defeated.

"Looks like that was the storage room's guard," Dave said. "Now we can safely enter the Main Kitchen."

They crossed the corridor and came to the door at the end. The door was marked "Main Kitchen," but there was also a small line below: "Danger! Seasoning Trap Zone!"

"Seasoning traps?" Dave frowned. "Looks like our challenges aren't over yet."

Buddy sniffed alertly at the door crack, growling softly, seeming to sense danger behind the door.

"No matter what's behind the door, we must face it," Dave said firmly. "We've come this far—we can't give up. Are you ready, Buddy?"

Buddy firmly barked once, indicating he was ready.

"Then let's continue forward!" Dave said, pushing open the door to the Main Kitchen.

Behind the door was a huge kitchen with various stoves, ovens, and work stations. But the entire kitchen looked very strange—the flames on the stoves were green, purple smoke billowed from the ovens, and the work stations were covered with bizarre ingredients, some even writhing.

"This is the core of the zombie kitchen," Dave said quietly. "It looks even more terrifying than I imagined."

Just then, a familiar voice came from the speakers: "Congratulations on finding the correct path! But this is only the beginning. Next, you will face the zombie kitchen's true challenge—seasoning traps! Good luck, you'll need it! Hahaha!"

Dave and Buddy looked at each other, knowing their adventure was just beginning. Ahead awaited more puzzles, traps, and dangers, but they were ready to meet the challenge.
