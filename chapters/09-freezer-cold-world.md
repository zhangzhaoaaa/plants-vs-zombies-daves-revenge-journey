# Chapter Nine: Freezer Cold World

Dave and Buddy faced the Zombie Head Chef, tension filling the luxurious office. The Head Chef's massive frying pan gleamed under the lights, his eyes burning with mad fury.

"You invaders!" the Zombie Head Chef roared. "How dare you destroy my carefully prepared culinary feast! Now I'll show you what I'm made of!"

He raised his frying pan and struck the ground heavily. The entire office began shaking violently, decorations falling from the walls. Suddenly, the wall behind the office slowly opened, revealing a massive entrance.

"What is that?" Dave asked in surprise.

From the entrance surged a wind even more bone-chilling than before, mixed with tiny ice crystals. This frigid wind was so intense that even the Zombie Head Chef's chef hat swayed unsteadily.

"Hahaha!" the Zombie Head Chef laughed maniacally. "Welcome to my ultimate freezer—the Cold World! The temperature here is lower than the Arctic, no living being can survive here!"

Buddy pressed close to Dave, his fur standing up from the cold. Dave also felt unprecedented chill—even wearing his thermal coat, his fingers began to go numb.

"We have to go in," Dave said firmly. "This might be the only path to the zombie doctor."

The Zombie Head Chef waved his frying pan in a welcoming gesture, his face bearing an evil smile: "Go ahead, go ahead! Let's see how long you can last in my Cold World!"

Dave and Buddy looked at each other, then bravely walked toward the entrance emanating frigid air.

As soon as they stepped into the Cold World, they were immediately shocked by the sight before them. This was a massive ice and snow world, ten times larger than the previous cold storage. The ceiling was so high it couldn't be seen, the surrounding walls were thick layers of ice carved with strange patterns. The ground was covered with deep snow that made "crunch crunch" sounds with each step.

Most shocking of all, throughout this icy world were massive figures frozen in ice. Some looked like giants, others like monsters, all wrapped in thick ice layers, completely motionless.

"These are... frozen zombies?" Dave carefully approached one of the frozen figures.

Through the transparent ice, he could see inside was a giant zombie at least three meters tall, muscular and looking incredibly strong. The zombie's eyes were closed, seemingly asleep.

"Woof woof!" Buddy suddenly barked alertly—his nose had detected danger.

Just then, the frozen zombie beside Dave suddenly opened its eyes! Those eyes emitted an eerie blue glow, staring directly at Dave through the ice.

"Oh no!" Dave exclaimed. "They're waking up!"

The frozen zombie began struggling within the ice, cracks appearing in the ice layer. Not only that, other frozen zombies around them also began awakening, filling the entire Cold World with the sound of cracking ice.

"Crack! Crack!"

The first frozen zombie broke free from the ice, its entire body covered in frost, leaving icy footprints with each step. It let out a deafening roar, then charged at Dave and Buddy.

"Run!" Dave pulled Buddy and quickly dodged. The frozen zombie's fist smashed into where they had just been standing, immediately forming a thick layer of ice on the ground.

More frozen zombies broke free from their ice prisons. Some wielded ice weapons, others could spray frost, and some could even create ice walls. The entire Cold World became a dangerous battlefield.

"We need fire!" Dave said while dodging attacks. "Only fire can deal with these frozen zombies!"

He took out several fire peashooter seeds from his backpack, but in this extremely cold environment, the seeds grew abnormally slowly. The fire peashooters that finally grew appeared weak and listless, their flames so faint they were barely visible.

"This won't work," Dave said anxiously. "Regular fire plants are too ineffective here!"

Buddy suddenly ran to Dave's side, pointing with his paw at a special pocket in his backpack. Dave opened it and found several seeds glowing bright red, emanating heat.

"These are... jalapeño seeds!" Dave said excitedly. "I almost forgot about these special seeds!"

The jalapeño seeds were rare seeds Dave had collected in previous adventures, said to produce extremely high temperatures specifically for fighting ice-type enemies.

He immediately planted a jalapeño seed. As soon as the seed touched the icy ground, it burst with intense heat, rapidly melting the surrounding ice and snow. The seed grew at an amazing rate, becoming a plant that was completely fiery red.

The jalapeño looked like a giant red pepper, but its surface burned with real flames. As soon as it appeared, the surrounding temperature immediately rose, even causing the air to distort.

"Excellent!" Dave said excitedly. "Jalapeño, show these frozen zombies what you've got!"

The jalapeño immediately began attacking. It sprayed scorching flames, directly hitting the nearest frozen zombie. When struck by the flames, the frozen zombie's frost immediately began melting, it roared in pain, and finally dissolved into a puddle of water.

"It works!" Dave cheered. "Keep attacking!"

He planted several more jalapeño seeds, and soon had a row of jalapeños burning in the Cold World. Their flames illuminated the entire icy world, and the temperature began to rise.

But there were simply too many frozen zombies. They swarmed from all directions, some even cooperating with each other, using ice walls for protection before launching flank attacks.

"We need more firepower!" Dave said. "Buddy, do you notice anything else?"

Buddy carefully observed the surrounding environment and suddenly discovered a massive ice pillar in the center of the Cold World, with something glowing at its top.

"Woof woof!" Buddy pointed toward the ice pillar.

Dave looked in the direction Buddy indicated and indeed saw a glowing object at the top of the ice pillar. The object was wrapped in thick ice layers, but its outline was still visible—it was a massive seed!

"What kind of seed is that?" Dave asked curiously. "It looks very special."

Just then, a frozen zombie launched a sneak attack from the side, its ice spear aimed directly at Dave's back.

"Watch out!" Buddy shouted, pouncing toward Dave and pushing him away. The ice spear grazed Dave's shoulder, tearing his coat.

"Thank you, Buddy!" Dave said gratefully, then immediately counterattacked. He commanded the jalapeños to focus their attack on the sneaking frozen zombie, quickly melting it.

"We have to find a way to reach that ice pillar," Dave said. "That seed might be our key!"

But the path to the ice pillar was blocked by countless frozen zombies. They formed dense formations, continuously launching attacks at Dave and Buddy.

Dave had a sudden inspiration and thought of a plan.

"Buddy, can you help me draw away some of the frozen zombies?" Dave asked. "I need a path to the ice pillar."

Buddy bravely nodded, then began running through the Cold World, deliberately making noise to attract the frozen zombies' attention. He was very fast, nimbly weaving through the ice and snow, successfully drawing away a large group of frozen zombies.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Dave commanded the jalapeños to create a flame corridor leading directly to the central ice pillar. He advanced quickly along this corridor, dodging attacks from the remaining frozen zombies.

Finally, Dave reached the base of the ice pillar. This pillar was even more massive than he had imagined, at least ten meters in diameter, with a height that couldn't be seen. The pillar's surface was smooth as a mirror, impossible to climb.

"How do I get up there?" Dave pondered.

He tried having the jalapeños melt the base of the ice pillar, but the pillar seemed to have some special power—the flames could only leave shallow marks on the surface without truly melting it.

Just then, Buddy ran back with a large group of angry frozen zombies following him.

"Buddy, come here!" Dave shouted.

Buddy jumped to Dave's side, then did something unexpected—he began digging at the ice and snow at the base of the ice pillar.

"What are you doing?" Dave asked, puzzled.

Soon, Buddy had dug out a small hole, revealing the ice pillar's internal structure. Dave was amazed to discover that the ice pillar was hollow inside, with a spiral passageway leading directly to the top!

"So clever, Buddy!" Dave marveled. "You discovered the ice pillar's secret!"

They quickly crawled inside the ice pillar and began climbing up the spiral passageway. The frozen zombies tried to follow, but the passageway inside the pillar was too narrow for their massive bodies to squeeze through.

Inside the ice pillar, Dave and Buddy could hear the angry roars of the frozen zombies outside, but they were now safe.

After a difficult climb, they finally reached the top of the ice pillar. Here, they saw the mysterious seed.

This seed was larger than any seed Dave had ever seen, as big as a basketball. It was golden-red throughout, with complex patterns on its surface, radiating warm light. Most amazingly, even in this extremely cold environment, the ice around the seed was slowly melting.

Beside the seed was an ice plaque carved with ancient text. Dave carefully made out the content:

"Heart of Flame—legendary ultimate fire plant seed. Can produce flames hot enough to melt any ice and snow, but only those who are truly brave can master its power."

"Heart of Flame!" Dave said excitedly. "This is exactly what we need!"

He carefully picked up the seed, which felt warm as spring in his hands, giving him unprecedented strength.

"Now, let's go back and give those frozen zombies a surprise!" Dave said.

They quickly descended the spiral passageway back to the ground of the Cold World. By now, the frozen zombies had gathered around the ice pillar, waiting for their appearance.

"Ready, Buddy?" Dave asked.

Buddy nodded firmly.

Dave planted the Heart of Flame seed in the ground. As soon as the seed touched the ground, it burst with amazing energy. The entire Cold World began shaking, ice and snow on the ground rapidly melting.

What grew from the seed wasn't a plant, but a massive flame. This flame was ten meters tall, shaped like a blooming flower, radiating golden-red light. Its temperature was so high that even the air began to burn.

"Flame Flower!" Dave marveled.

As soon as the Flame Flower appeared, the temperature of the entire Cold World immediately rose. The frozen zombies began melting in the intense heat wave, they retreated in terror, but it was too late.

The Flame Flower began rotating, releasing countless flame bullets. Each flame bullet accurately hit a frozen zombie, instantly melting them. In less than a few minutes, all the frozen zombies had disappeared, leaving only puddles of water on the ground.

The ice and snow of the Cold World also rapidly melted under the Flame Flower's heat, revealing the original metal floors and walls. It turned out this had originally been a huge warehouse, just transformed into an icy world by the Zombie Head Chef.

"We did it!" Dave excitedly lifted Buddy. "The Heart of Flame is so powerful!"

After completing its mission, the Flame Flower gradually shrank, finally returning to seed form and flying back into Dave's backpack. But the warmth it left behind still permeated the Cold World.

Just then, they heard footsteps behind them. Looking back, they saw the Zombie Head Chef angrily walking in.

"Impossible!" the Zombie Head Chef roared. "How could my Cold World be destroyed by you!"

Seeing the puddles everywhere and the completely changed environment, the fury in his eyes blazed even more intensely.

"You detestable invaders!" the Zombie Head Chef raised his frying pan. "I'll personally take care of you!"

Dave and Buddy knew the real battle was just beginning. But they were no longer afraid, because they possessed the power of the Heart of Flame.

"Come on, Zombie Head Chef!" Dave said bravely. "Let's see who's stronger!"

In the melted Cold World, a decisive battle was about to begin...
