# Chapter Fourteen: Elevator Terror

Dave, Buddy, and Arthur stood before the massive metal door of the biochemical laboratory, with two robot guards' red eyes staring intently at them. These robots were three meters tall, covered in heavy metal armor, with flickering energy cores on their chests.

"Intruders detected," the left robot said in a mechanical voice. "Initiating defense protocols."

"Warning: Unauthorized entry into restricted zone," the right robot also spoke. "Will execute elimination protocol."

Both robots simultaneously raised their weapons—devices that looked like laser cannons. Red targeting dots moved across Dave and his companions.

"Looks like we need to deal with these two big guys first," Dave said, raising his Magical Seed Launcher.

"Be careful," Arthur warned. "These are the Zombie Doctor's advanced guard robots. Their armor is very thick—normal attacks might be ineffective."

"Woof woof!" Buddy growled alertly, ready to act at any moment.

Just then, the left robot opened fire. A red laser shot toward Dave, who quickly dodged as the laser hit the wall behind him, leaving a smoking hole.

"That's really powerful!" Dave said in surprise.

He immediately fired several peashooter seeds, and the peashooters quickly grew and began attacking. But the peas hitting the robots' armor only made "ding ding clang" sounds without causing any damage.

"As expected, normal attacks are ineffective," Dave said. "We need stronger firepower."

"Try Plant Fusion Technique," Arthur suggested.

Dave nodded, firing jalapeño and peashooter seeds, then using Plant Fusion Technique to fuse them. A "Fire Shooter" capable of firing flame peas appeared.

The flame peas hit the robot's armor, causing some damage, but the robot remained fully operational.

"We need stronger attacks," Dave thought. "Right! We have the power left by the Forest Guardian!"

He concentrated, feeling the Forest Guardian's power contained within his Magical Seed Launcher. Suddenly, the launcher began emitting green light.

"Forces of nature, heed my call!" Dave shouted.

He fired a special seed that began glowing in mid-air, and after landing, quickly grew into a massive "Lightning Flower." This plant's blossom was like a small thundercloud, constantly flickering with electric light.

"Lightning attack!" Dave commanded.

The Lightning Flower fired a powerful bolt of lightning, striking the left robot. Electric current spread across the robot's metal body, and it began smoking, its movements becoming sluggish.

"It works!" Dave said excitedly. "Electric attacks are very effective against robots!"

But the right robot had learned from this lesson and began moving, avoiding the Lightning Flower's attack range while firing lasers at Dave and his companions.

The battle intensified as they fought the mechanical guardians. Through teamwork and strategic use of plant magic, they eventually disabled both robots and gained access to the laboratory complex.

Inside, they discovered the true extent of the Zombie Doctor's experiments and began their final approach to confront him directly.
