# Chapter Seven: Seasoning Trap

Dave and Buddy stood in the main kitchen of the zombie kitchen, alertly surveying their surroundings. This enormous space was filled with various strange kitchen utensils and equipment: stoves with green flames, ovens billowing purple smoke, writhing ingredients, and sharp knives hanging on the walls. The air was filled with a bizarre mixture of spices, decay, and chemicals.

"Seasoning traps," Dave quietly repeated Pierre's words. "We need to be extra careful."

Buddy's nose twitched uneasily—he could smell far more than Dave, and each scent warned him that danger was approaching.

They carefully walked toward the center of the kitchen. The floor was smooth tiles decorated with complex food patterns. Various dried herbs and strange plants hung from the ceiling, some even glowing faintly.

"Look over there," Dave pointed to a door at the far end of the kitchen. "That should be the exit to the next area."

The door was marked "Cold Storage," appearing to be their intended destination. But to reach it, they had to cross the entire kitchen.

"Seems too quiet," Dave said. "Where are the traps Pierre mentioned?"

Just then, a huge work table in the center of the kitchen suddenly began to shake. Various spice jars placed on the surface started jumping, their lids popping off one by one.

"I think we're about to find out," Dave said nervously.

Countless tiny particles flew out from the spice jars, forming small tornadoes in the air. These particles gradually gathered and took human form—zombies made of various seasonings!

"Seasoning zombies!" Dave exclaimed.

The first to take shape was a bright red zombie made of chili powder, with eyes flickering like flames, leaving scorching traces on the ground with each step.

"Chili Zombie!" Dave recognized this dangerous enemy.

Next, a second zombie formed—this one was snow white, made of salt crystals, with arms ending in sharp salt formations that looked capable of slicing through anything.

"Salt Zombie!" Dave continued identifying them.

More seasoning zombies formed from various spice jars: Black Pepper Zombie, Turmeric Zombie, Cinnamon Zombie... each with unique abilities and attack methods.

"We're surrounded, Buddy!" Dave said tensely. "Prepare for battle!"

The Chili Zombie was the first to attack. It took a deep breath and then spewed a stream of fire directly at Dave and Buddy.

"Watch out!" Dave pulled Buddy behind a metal work table. The flames hit the table, immediately turning the metal red-hot.

"These guys are even more dangerous than I thought!" Dave said, taking several peashooter seeds from his backpack. "We need plant helpers!"

He quickly planted the seeds, and the peashooters rapidly grew and began firing peas at the seasoning zombies. But ordinary peas had limited effect on these special zombies—peas passing through the Salt Zombie only left small holes that were quickly filled with salt particles, while peas hitting the Chili Zombie evaporated from the high heat.

"This isn't working!" Dave said anxiously. "We need more powerful plants!"

Just then, the Salt Zombie attacked. It swung its sharp salt crystal arms, cutting several peashooters into pieces.

"No!" Dave cried out.

Buddy suddenly barked, drawing Dave's attention. He pointed toward a refrigerator in the corner of the kitchen.

"Refrigerator?" Dave asked, puzzled, but then understood Buddy's meaning. "Right! Hot things fear cold, and salt dissolves in water! We need ice and water!"

Dave took out a blue seed from his backpack—this was from a special plant he had collected in the swamp.

"Snow Pea!" Dave planted the seed in the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed rapidly sprouted and grew into a blue plant, similar in shape to a peashooter but ice-blue in color, with leaves covered in a thin layer of frost. The Snow Pea began firing frozen peas, each sparkling with cold light.

When the frozen peas hit the Chili Zombie, the effect was immediate—the Chili Zombie's flames were instantly extinguished, its body began to freeze, and its movements became sluggish.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Snow Peas are very effective against Chili Zombies!"

He planted several more Snow Pea seeds, and together they attacked the Chili Zombie, quickly freezing it completely. The frozen Chili Zombie became an ice sculpture, then shattered into countless ice fragments.

But the Salt Zombie and other seasoning zombies were still advancing. Snow Peas had limited effect on the Salt Zombie, with frozen peas only temporarily slowing its speed.

"We need more types of plants!" Dave said, continuing to search his backpack for suitable seeds.

Buddy again drew Dave's attention, this time pointing to the kitchen sink.

"Water!" Dave suddenly understood. "Salt dissolves in water! We need aquatic plants!"

He took out a green seed—one he had collected during his water adventure.

"Squirt-gun Grass!" Dave planted the seed in the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed rapidly sprouted and grew into a green plant shaped like a small water gun. The Squirt-gun Grass began spraying high-pressure water streams, directly hitting the Salt Zombie.

When struck by the water stream, the Salt Zombie immediately began to dissolve, its salt crystal arms lost their shape, and its body began to collapse.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Squirt-gun Grass is very effective against Salt Zombies!"

He planted several more Squirt-gun Grass seeds, and together they attacked the Salt Zombie, quickly dissolving it completely, leaving only a puddle of salt water.

But other seasoning zombies were still advancing, each with unique abilities and weaknesses.

"We need to figure out each seasoning zombie's weakness," Dave said to Buddy. "What do you notice?"

Buddy observed the remaining seasoning zombies, then ran to different corners of the kitchen, pointing with his paws at various items—vinegar bottles, sugar jars, lemon juice...

"I understand!" Dave said. "Every seasoning has its natural enemy! We need to use the materials in the kitchen!"

He quickly collected the items Buddy had pointed out, then began making improvised weapons. He filled spray bottles with vinegar, made sticky traps with sugar and water, filled water guns with lemon juice...

"Ready, Buddy!" Dave said. "Let's tackle these seasoning zombies together!"

They began systematically dealing with each seasoning zombie: using vinegar spray against alkaline Baking Soda Zombies, using sugar traps to capture acidic Vinegar Zombies, using lemon juice to neutralize alkaline Baking Soda Zombies...

Meanwhile, Snow Peas and Squirt-gun Grass continued their attacks, providing cover for Dave and Buddy.

After intense battle, most of the seasoning zombies were defeated. But just when they thought victory was within reach, the work table in the center of the kitchen shook again, this time more violently.

"It's not over yet!" Dave said alertly.

All the spice jars on the work table opened simultaneously, all seasonings mixing together to form a huge tornado. From the center of the tornado, a massive figure gradually formed—a super seasoning zombie made from all the seasonings combined!

"Seasoning Master!" Dave exclaimed. "It's a fusion of all the seasoning zombies!"

The Seasoning Master stood three meters tall, its body composed of various seasonings forming a colorful whirlpool. Its hands could transform into any weapon, and its eyes flickered with dangerous light.

"This is trouble," Dave said. "It combines all the seasoning zombies' abilities—our previous strategies might not work."

The Seasoning Master let out a deafening roar, then simultaneously released flames, salt crystals, acid, and various other attacks.

"Take cover!" Dave pulled Buddy behind a large pot. Various attacks struck the pot's exterior, creating harsh sounds.

"We need a new plan," Dave thought. "If it combines all the seasoning zombies' abilities, then it should also inherit their weaknesses..."

Buddy suddenly perked up his ears, seeming to hear something. He ran to a corner of the kitchen and used his claws to dig up a loose floor tile, revealing the entrance to a small underground chamber.

"What did you find, Buddy?" Dave asked curiously, following Buddy into the underground chamber.

The chamber contained various special plant seeds, each labeled with its name and purpose. One particularly caught their attention—a colorful seed labeled "Rainbow Shooter: Can fire various elemental peas."

"This is exactly what we need!" Dave said excitedly, picking up the Rainbow Shooter seed. "With this, we can handle all of the Seasoning Master's abilities simultaneously!"

They quickly returned to the kitchen to find the Seasoning Master destroying kitchen equipment while searching for their traces.

"Hey, Seasoning Master!" Dave shouted, drawing its attention. "Try this!"

He planted the Rainbow Shooter seed in the ground. The seed rapidly sprouted and grew into a unique plant—its flower was rainbow-colored like a rainbow, and its stem sparkled with various elemental lights.

The Rainbow Shooter began firing various elemental peas: flame peas, frozen peas, water peas, acidic peas, alkaline peas... each targeting different parts of the Seasoning Master.

Flame peas melted the ice elements in its body, frozen peas extinguished its flame parts, water peas dissolved its salt content, and acidic and alkaline peas neutralized each other...

Under the Rainbow Shooter's attack, the Seasoning Master began to disintegrate, its body parts canceling each other out, gradually losing shape.

"Keep attacking!" Dave encouraged. "It's falling apart!"

The Rainbow Shooter intensified its attack, firing more elemental peas. The Seasoning Master let out a painful roar, then exploded into a cloud of colorful powder that scattered across the kitchen floor.

"We did it!" Dave cheered, lifting Buddy and spinning around. "Thanks to you finding the Rainbow Shooter seed!"

Buddy happily licked Dave's face, then jumped down and wagged his tail.

They looked around to find the kitchen was in complete disarray—work tables overturned, pots and pans scattered everywhere, traces of various seasonings on the walls and ceiling.

"Looks like we passed the seasoning trap challenge," Dave said, pointing to the door at the other end of the kitchen. "Now we can continue forward."

They walked toward the door marked "Cold Storage," preparing to face the next challenge. But just as Dave reached to push the door, he noticed a small control panel on the wall beside the door, with a display screen and several buttons.

The screen flashed a message: "Warning: Cold Storage temperature abnormal. Large amounts of frozen zombie activity detected. Recommend wearing protective gear before entering."

"Frozen zombies?" Dave frowned. "Looks like our next challenge will be fighting in extremely cold conditions."

Buddy sneezed, seeming to already feel the chill from behind the door.

"Don't worry, Buddy," Dave comforted, taking two small thermal coats from his backpack, one for himself and one for Buddy. "We're prepared. Plus, we have fire plants to help us fight the cold."

They put on the thermal coats, and Dave checked his seed supply in the backpack, ensuring they had enough fire plant seeds.

"Ready, buddy?" Dave asked.

Buddy nodded firmly, though his nose was slightly red from the chill.

"Then let's continue our adventure!" Dave said, pushing open the door to Cold Storage.

A bone-chilling wind rushed at them, mixed with tiny snowflakes. The world behind the door was completely icy—the ground covered with thick ice, icicles hanging from the walls, snowflakes floating in the air. This wasn't just cold storage—it was a miniature polar world!

And in the depths of this icy world, countless pairs of glowing blue eyes watched them—the eyes of frozen zombies, waiting for new prey...
