# Chapter Eleven: Recipe Room Secret

The Zombie Head Chef angrily waved his massive frying pan, its bottom still bearing ash from the oven. His chef hat sat crookedly on his head, his eyes burning with furious flames.

"You've destroyed my masterpieces!" the Zombie Head Chef roared. "I spent decades building the perfect oven, and now you've ruined it all!"

Dave held Buddy tightly, preparing for this final showdown. But just as the Zombie Head Chef raised his frying pan to attack, a strange "gurgling" sound suddenly echoed.

"What's that sound?" Dave asked puzzledly.

The Zombie Head Chef also stopped his movement, looking around in confusion. The sound seemed to come from the wall behind the oven.

"Woof woof!" Buddy suddenly barked excitedly—his nose had detected something special.

Buddy jumped down from Dave's arms and ran to the wall, sniffing carefully. There was an almost invisible crack, and from it emanated a unique fragrance—both the fresh scent of herbs and the mysterious aura of magic.

"What's in there?" Dave walked over, feeling the wall with his hand.

Suddenly, the wall began glowing, revealing ancient runes. These runes flickered with green light, seeming to respond to the energy of the plant seeds in Dave's backpack.

"This is... ancient plant magic!" Dave said in surprise.

Seeing this scene, the Zombie Head Chef's face suddenly turned pale.

"No... impossible..." he stammered. "That room should have been sealed forever..."

"What room?" Dave pressed.

The Zombie Head Chef seemed to realize he had said too much and quickly shut his mouth. But the runes on the wall grew brighter and brighter, and finally with a "boom," the entire wall vanished, revealing a mysterious room.

This room was completely different from anywhere they had seen before. The room was filled with ancient alchemical equipment: large cauldrons emitting colorful smoke, glass bottles filled with strange liquids, crystal balls floating in mid-air, and countless plant specimens radiating magical light.

"This is... the Recipe Room!" Dave said in shock.

In the center of the room was a massive stone table with a thick ancient book placed on it. The book's cover was written in ancient script: "Plant Magic Compendium: Ultimate Recipe Collection."

"Woof woof!" Buddy excitedly ran toward the book.

"Wait, Buddy!" Dave quickly followed. "There might be traps here."

But surprisingly, when Buddy approached the book, it opened automatically, radiating gentle green light. Beautiful illustrations and text appeared on the pages, as if welcoming their arrival.

"It seems this book accepts us," Dave carefully approached. "Let me see what's written inside."

The first page read:

"Welcome, Plant Guardian. If you can see these words, it means you possess a pure heart and strong plant affinity. This book records the ultimate secrets of ancient plant mages—how to create magical plant potions that give ordinary plants extraordinary power."

Dave continued turning pages, finding the book recorded various magical recipes:

- Growth Potion: Makes plants grow gigantic
- Speed Potion: Doubles plant attack speed  
- Shield Potion: Gives plants protective barriers
- Elemental Potion: Grants plants fire, ice, lightning and other elemental powers
- Healing Potion: Quickly restores plant vitality

"Amazing!" Dave said excitedly. "With these recipes, our plants can become much more powerful!"

Just then, the Zombie Head Chef's angry voice came from behind:

"You can't touch that book! That's forbidden power!"

Dave turned to see the Zombie Head Chef trying to rush into the Recipe Room, but an invisible barrier seemed to block him.

"You can't enter?" Dave asked curiously.

"This room only allows true Plant Guardians to enter," the Zombie Head Chef said through gritted teeth. "But you don't understand—those powers are too dangerous! It was because someone misused these recipes that the great war between plants and zombies began!"

Dave paused, stunned. "You mean... you know this history?"

The Zombie Head Chef's expression became complex. "I... I was once a plant mage too. But I was corrupted by power and became what I am now."

This shocking truth stunned both Dave and Buddy. The Zombie Head Chef had once been one of their kind!

"Then why are you trying to stop us?" Dave asked.

"Because I don't want to see history repeat itself," the Zombie Head Chef said painfully. "Power makes people lose themselves."

Dave thought for a moment, then said firmly: "I understand your concern, but we need these powers to protect our homeland. I promise we'll only use them for the right reasons."

He continued reading the ancient book, searching for the most suitable recipe for their current situation. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a special recipe:

"Friendship Potion: Can purify beings corrupted by dark forces, helping them rediscover their true selves. Required materials: Pure Water, Friendship Blossom, Hope Leaf, Courage Fruit."

"Buddy, look at this!" Dave excitedly pointed to the recipe. "Maybe we can help the Zombie Head Chef return to his original form!"

Buddy barked twice, showing agreement.

Dave began searching the Recipe Room for materials to make the Friendship Potion. Surprisingly, this room had everything needed. He quickly found all the required materials:

- Pure Water: Obtained from a crystal bottle, clear as diamond
- Friendship Blossom: A golden flower radiating warm light
- Hope Leaf: Sparkling silver leaves
- Courage Fruit: A small red fruit that conveyed strength when held

"Now let's begin!" Dave said.

Following the book's instructions, Dave added the materials one by one to an ancient alchemical cauldron. The pot immediately began glowing, and the liquid inside turned a beautiful rainbow color.

"Gurgle gurgle..." The potion in the pot bubbled, emanating a warm and healing fragrance.

After several minutes, the potion was complete. Dave carefully poured it into a small bottle.

"Zombie Head Chef!" Dave approached the barrier holding the potion. "This is a Friendship Potion—it can help you return to your original form!"

The Zombie Head Chef looked at the sparkling potion, hope flickering in his eyes, but then he became hesitant.

"I... I'm not sure..." he said. "I've been like this for so long—maybe this is the punishment I deserve."

"Everyone deserves a second chance," Dave said sincerely. "Trust us, trust in the power of friendship."

Buddy also barked, looking at the Zombie Head Chef with sincere eyes.

Finally, the Zombie Head Chef was moved by their sincerity. He slowly extended his hand and accepted the Friendship Potion.

"If this really works..." he took a deep breath, "then I can start over."

He drank the potion in one gulp.

Instantly, the Zombie Head Chef's body began glowing. His rotting skin gradually regained its color, his hollow eyes regained their vitality, and his tattered chef's coat became clean and neat. Most amazingly, the putrid zombie smell disappeared, replaced by the fresh scent of herbs.

"I... I can feel it!" he said excitedly. "I can feel the power of life!"

The barrier also disappeared, and now he could freely enter the Recipe Room.

"Thank you," he said with tears in his eyes. "My name is Arthur. I was once the head plant mage here. I fell to darkness pursuing excessive power and became a zombie. For all these years, I've been seeking a chance for redemption."

"Now you've found it," Dave smiled. "We can work together to fight the real evil."

Arthur nodded. "You're right. The real enemy isn't me, but the dark force controlling all zombies—the Zombie Doctor. He's in the deepest part of this kitchen."

"Then we need more preparation," Dave said. "Arthur, can you help us make some powerful plant potions?"

"Of course!" Arthur said excitedly. "Let me teach you some advanced recipes."

Over the following time, Arthur taught Dave how to make various magical plant potions:

First was the "Growth Potion." Arthur guided Dave in mixing giant grass essence, magnification crystal powder, and growth hormones. When completed, this potion glowed green.

"Just one drop will make plants ten times their original size," Arthur explained.

Next was the "Speed Potion," requiring lightning flower pollen, time crystal fragments, and swift grass leaves. The finished potion was silver with tiny lightning bolts swimming inside.

"This triples plant attack speed," Arthur said.

Then came the "Shield Potion," using iron tree bark, protection stone powder, and tough vine sap. The completed potion was golden and looked indestructible.

"This gives plants powerful protective shields," Arthur introduced.

Finally, Arthur taught Dave to make "Elemental Fusion Potion"—the highest-level recipe, requiring flame flower petals, frost grass roots, lightning tree fruit, and earth stone essence.

"This potion allows plants to master four elemental powers simultaneously," Arthur said seriously, "but be extra careful when using it—too much power might spiral out of control."

After making all the potions, Dave's backpack was filled with various colored magical potion bottles. Each radiated different light, containing powerful forces.

"Now we're ready," Dave said. "It's time to face the Zombie Doctor."

"Wait," Arthur said. "There's one more thing you need."

He walked to a corner of the Recipe Room and took out a peculiar weapon from an ancient chest. It looked like a water gun but was much larger than ordinary water guns and radiated magical light throughout.

"This is the plant mage's specialized weapon—the Magical Seed Launcher," Arthur said. "It can shoot not only seeds but also potions. With this, you can quickly apply various potions to plants during battle."

Dave took this magical weapon, feeling it resonate with his plant abilities.

"Fantastic!" Dave said excitedly. "Now I really feel ready."

"Woof woof!" Buddy also barked excitedly, seeming to sense his master's increased power.

Just then, the entire kitchen suddenly began shaking. Evil laughter echoed from the distance, filled with malice and threat.

"It's the Zombie Doctor!" Arthur's face grew grave. "He's sensed our power and is summoning all his zombie armies."

"Then we can't just sit and wait," Dave said firmly. "It's time to take the offensive!"

The three of them (plus Buddy) left the Recipe Room, preparing to head to the kitchen's deepest parts. Dave carried a backpack full of magical potions and wielded the Magical Seed Launcher; Arthur had regained his identity as a plant mage, holding a magic staff radiating life force; Buddy was energetic and ready to help his companions with agility and intelligence.

"Ahead is the Banquet Hall," Arthur pointed to a massive double door ahead. "That's usually where zombies gather. We must be careful—the Zombie Doctor may have already set traps there."

"Whatever traps await, we'll break through," Dave said bravely. "For protecting our homeland, for all creatures threatened by zombies!"

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked in agreement.

"Then let's go end this together," Arthur said. "It's time to make the Zombie Doctor pay for his crimes!"

They pushed open the doors to the Banquet Hall, preparing for the next challenge. Music and noisy sounds came from behind the doors, as if some grand event was underway.

"Sounds like... a party?" Dave said puzzledly.

"A zombie party," Arthur explained. "This isn't a good sign. Usually only before launching large-scale attacks does the Zombie Doctor host such gatherings."

Dave gripped his Magical Seed Launcher tightly. "Then let's crash their party!"

As the doors fully opened, a new challenge presented itself. But now they were no longer ordinary adventurers—they possessed ancient plant magic, powerful potions, and most importantly, unbreakable friendship between them.
