# Chapter Thirteen: Underground Warehouse

The underground warehouse was even more massive than Dave had imagined. In the dim light, countless boxes, shelves, and strange containers piled up like mountains, forming a complex maze. The air was filled with the musty smell of age and some mysterious chemical scent.

"Woof woof!" Buddy alertly scouted ahead, his nose constantly sniffing, trying to distinguish which boxes were real and which were disguised zombies.

"Be careful," Arthur whispered. "Box zombies are very cunning. They can remain completely still until prey approaches, then suddenly attack."

Dave raised his Magical Seed Launcher, carefully following behind Buddy. Suddenly, he noticed a wooden box on the left that seemed to be trembling slightly.

"That one!" Dave pointed to the suspicious box.

As soon as he spoke, the wooden box suddenly snapped open with a "pop," and a zombie made entirely of wood jumped out. Its body was like an unfolded box, with arms and legs made of wooden planks, and a head that was a small wooden box with an eerie smile painted on it.

"Hahaha! Gotcha!" the Box Zombie let out a piercing laugh. "Welcome to our storage room!"

Dave quickly fired a peashooter seed. The peashooter immediately grew and began shooting at the Box Zombie. But surprisingly, the peas hitting the Box Zombie only made "thunk thunk" sounds, just like hitting a real wooden box.

"They have strong defense!" Dave said in surprise.

"Use fire plants!" Arthur suggested. "Wood fears fire!"

Dave immediately fired a jalapeño seed. After the jalapeño grew, it spewed flames. The Box Zombie was hit by the flames, immediately began burning, and let out painful screams.

"Ahhh! Don't burn me! I just wanted to play hide-and-seek with you!" the Box Zombie cried while burning, finally turning to ash.

But this was just the beginning. With the first Box Zombie's defeat, the entire warehouse came "alive." Boxes everywhere began opening, revealing various types of zombies:

Cardboard Box Zombies: Made entirely of cardboard, agile but fragile.
Metal Box Zombies: Bodies made of metal, extremely high defense but slow movement.
Refrigerator Zombies: Looking like old refrigerators, capable of spraying freezing gas.
Safe Zombies: Small but sturdy, capable of rolling attacks.

"Good heavens, how many zombies are in here?" Dave exclaimed.

"Woof woof woof!" Buddy suddenly barked excitedly—he had discovered something important.

Buddy ran to a corner deep in the warehouse where there was a particularly large ancient wooden box. This box was different from the others, carved with complex runes and patterns, looking very ancient.

"This box..." Arthur approached to examine it carefully. "These runes are ancient plant magic script. This could be a very important discovery."

"But first we need to deal with these zombies," Dave said, as the Box Zombies around them were closing in.

Dave began strategically using different plants to deal with different types of Box Zombies:

Against Cardboard Box Zombies, he used jalapeños—they caught fire instantly.
Against Metal Box Zombies, he used Magnet-shrooms, which could control the metal zombies' movements.
Against Refrigerator Zombies, he used Torchwood, whose flames could melt freezing attacks.
Against Safe Zombies, he used Wall-nuts to block their rolling attacks.

"Arthur, can you help decipher the runes on that ancient box?" Dave asked while fighting.

"I'll try," Arthur began carefully studying the runes on the box. "These texts are very ancient... let me think..."

The battle was intense. Though the Box Zombies each had their characteristics, they gradually fell before Dave's plant army. Buddy was also very helpful, nimbly weaving through the zombie horde, occasionally biting a zombie's "handle" or "lock," preventing them from functioning properly.

"I've deciphered it!" Arthur suddenly called out excitedly. "This box contains 'Plant History Archives'! It records all the history and secrets of plant magic!"

"Then we must open it!" Dave said.

But just then, the last Box Zombie appeared—a massive Container Zombie. It was three stories tall, its entire body made of heavy metal, looking like a mobile fortress.

"Hahaha!" the Container Zombie let out thunderous laughter. "You think you can easily take our treasure? I am the guardian here!"

It opened its massive "mouth" (actually the container's door), and countless small Box Zombies poured out.

"This guy is a zombie factory!" Dave said in surprise.

"We need to find a way to stop it from making more zombies," Arthur said. "Maybe we can use the knowledge from that ancient box."

Arthur quickly opened the ancient box. Inside were indeed ancient scrolls and books recording various plant magic secrets.

"Found it!" Arthur pulled out a thick book. "'Plant Summoning Compendium'! This records how to summon legendary plant guardians!"

"Plant guardians?" Dave asked curiously.

"Yes," Arthur quickly flipped through the pages. "This is an ancient magic that can summon powerful plant spirits to help in battle. But it requires special incantations and materials."

"What materials do we have?" Dave asked.

Arthur checked his backpack. "We have moonflower petals, star fruit seeds, and... oh right! That sheet music you picked up in the Banquet Hall! The runes on it are part of the summoning spell!"

Dave immediately took out the sheet music. Under the mysterious light from the ancient box, the runes on the music began glowing.

"Quick, follow the book's instructions!" Arthur said.

Dave scattered the moonflower petals and star fruit seeds on the ground, then began reciting the incantation following the runes on the sheet music. Though he didn't understand these ancient words, strangely, when he looked at the runes, he naturally knew how to pronounce them.

"Ancient spirits of plants, heed my call,
With moonlight as guide, with starlight as power,
Warriors who guard nature, appear!"

As the incantation completed, the ground began glowing. A massive circle of light appeared, and from it slowly rose a majestic figure.

This was a giant plant warrior composed of vines, flowers, and leaves. It had a human shape but was entirely green with plants. Its head was a massive sunflower, its chest bore a sparkling heart of life, and its arms were thick vines that could extend freely.

"I am the Forest Guardian," the plant warrior spoke in a deep, majestic voice. "Who has summoned me?"

"We have!" Dave said excitedly. "We need your help to deal with that big zombie!"

The Forest Guardian looked at the Container Zombie and nodded. "Evil metal monster, you have defiled this land. I shall purify you!"

An epic battle began. The Forest Guardian and Container Zombie engaged in fierce combat.

The Forest Guardian's vine arms could extend dozens of meters, whipping the Container Zombie like whips. Its sunflower head could fire powerful sunlight beams, a hundred times more powerful than ordinary peashooters.

The Container Zombie fought back, using its massive metal fists to pound the Forest Guardian, each punch causing tremendous vibrations. It also continuously spat out small zombies from its "mouth" to interfere with the Forest Guardian.

"We need to help too!" Dave said.

He and Arthur began coordinating with the Forest Guardian. Dave used his plant army to clear the small zombies while Arthur used magic to enhance the Forest Guardian's power.

"Woof woof!" Buddy wasn't idle either—he nimbly climbed behind the Container Zombie and bit its "power cable" (actually some control circuits).

"Good job, Buddy!" Dave praised.

With Buddy destroying the Container Zombie's control system, the massive zombie began malfunctioning. Its movements became sluggish, and it could no longer create new small zombies.

The Forest Guardian seized this opportunity, tightly wrapping the Container Zombie with its vine arms, then firing the most powerful sunlight beam.

"Purifying Light!" the Forest Guardian shouted.

Intense golden light surrounded the Container Zombie. In this sacred light, the zombie began melting and finally disappeared completely.

"We won!" Dave cheered excitedly.

"Woof woof woof!" Buddy also barked happily.

After completing its mission, the Forest Guardian began slowly becoming transparent. "My duty is complete," it said. "Young plant mage, you have a pure heart and great potential. Continue your journey—nature's power is with you."

With that, the Forest Guardian dissolved into countless points of light, but these lights didn't completely disappear—instead, they merged into Dave's Magical Seed Launcher.

"Wow!" Dave was surprised to find his weapon now glowed with a faint green light. "I feel like it's become more powerful!"

"The Forest Guardian left part of its power with you," Arthur explained. "Now your plant magic will be even stronger."

With all the Box Zombies gone, the underground warehouse returned to calm. Dave and his companions began exploring this massive space, searching for more useful items.

In the ancient box, besides the "Plant Summoning Compendium," they found many precious items:

Ancient seeds: Seeds of extinct plants, including the legendary "Time Flower" and "Space Vine."
Magic potion recipes: Records of various powerful potion-making methods.
Historical records: Detailed records of the ancient war between plants and zombies.
Maps: Ancient maps showing the complete layout of the Zombie Doctor's base.

"This map is so useful!" Arthur said excitedly. "Look, it shows the exact location of the Zombie Doctor's laboratory, plus the locations of various traps and secret passages."

Dave studied the map carefully. "According to this map, we're here now," he pointed to a location on the map. "To reach the Zombie Doctor's laboratory, we need to go through the elevator shaft, then pass through the experimental area."

"But look here," Arthur pointed to some red markings on the map. "These are all danger zones. The elevator shaft is marked as 'falling trap,' and the experimental area is marked as 'mutant creature danger.'"

"No matter how dangerous, we must continue forward," Dave said firmly. "The Zombie Doctor must pay for his crimes."

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked in agreement, his eyes sparkling with brave light.

They gathered all useful items, preparing to leave the underground warehouse. At the other end of the warehouse, they found the entrance to the elevator shaft. It was a massive metal door with "DANGER: UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY PROHIBITED" written on it.

"Looks like we found the right place," Dave said.

Arthur used magic to open the metal door. Behind it was a huge shaft with an old freight elevator inside. But the elevator looked like it hadn't been maintained in ages, covered with rust and damage everywhere.

"This elevator doesn't look very safe," Arthur said worriedly.

"According to the map, this is the only way," Dave said. "We have no choice."

Just as they were about to enter the elevator, Dave suddenly remembered something. "Wait," he said. "We've discovered so many valuable historical materials here—maybe we should spend some time studying them to learn more about the Zombie Doctor."

Arthur nodded. "You're right. Know yourself and know your enemy, and you'll never be defeated."

They found a relatively safe corner to sit down and began carefully studying the historical records.

From these ancient documents, they learned a shocking truth:

The Zombie Doctor wasn't born evil. Long, long ago, he had been an outstanding botanist named Dr. Edgar Zomboss. He was dedicated to researching how plants and humans could better coexist, even developing many beneficial plant magics.

However, in an experimental accident, he came into contact with a mysterious "Death Spore." This spore not only changed his body, turning him into a half-zombie state, but also twisted his mind, making him hate plants.

"So he became the Zombie Doctor because of an accident," Dave said thoughtfully. "Maybe... maybe there's still a chance he can be saved?"

"That's hard to say," Arthur shook his head. "The influence of Death Spores is very profound. However," he turned to another page, "this mentions a plant magic called 'Light of Life,' which supposedly can purify any form of death magic."

"Light of Life?" Dave asked curiously.

"Yes, but this is extremely advanced magic, requiring enormous life energy and a pure heart to cast. Moreover," Arthur continued reading, "the caster must truly wish to save the target, without any hatred or malice."

Dave was silent for a moment. "If there's a chance, I'd like to try. Everyone should have a second chance, even the Zombie Doctor."

"Woof woof," Buddy softly barked, seeming to agree with Dave's thinking.

"Your kindness is admirable," Arthur said, "but we must prepare for the worst. If the Zombie Doctor refuses to be saved, we must stop him."

"I understand," Dave nodded.

They continued studying the documents, learning more useful plant magic and combat techniques. Especially the "Plant Summoning Compendium," which recorded many powerful summoning spells, though most required special materials and conditions.

"Look at this," Arthur pointed to a page in the book. "'Plant Fusion Technique.' This spell can temporarily fuse multiple plants, creating more powerful hybrid plants."

"Sounds very useful," Dave said. "Let's learn it."

They spent time practicing this new spell. Dave discovered that through Plant Fusion Technique, he could fuse peashooters with jalapeños to create "Fire Shooters" that could fire flame peas; or fuse Wall-nuts with Snow Peas to create "Ice Walls" that could freeze enemies.

"Fantastic!" Dave said excitedly. "With these new skills, our chances against the Zombie Doctor are even better."

"But remember," Arthur reminded, "fusion plants consume a lot of energy—don't overuse them."

After thorough preparation, they were finally ready to continue forward. Dave packed all useful items into his backpack, including those precious seeds, potion recipes, and maps.

"Ready to face the next challenge?" Dave asked his companions.

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked bravely.

"Ready when you are," Arthur gripped his magic staff.

They walked toward the old elevator. Though it looked dangerous, according to the map, this was the necessary path to the Zombie Doctor's laboratory.

Dave pressed the elevator button. With a harsh metal grinding sound, the elevator doors slowly opened. Inside was a rust-covered metal box that looked like it could fall at any moment.

"Hope this thing still works," Dave said, carefully stepping into the elevator.

Buddy and Arthur also entered. The elevator was small, and three people (plus a dog) made it quite crowded.

Dave pressed the button marked "Experimental Level." The elevator began slowly descending, making unsettling "creak creak" sounds.

"That sound doesn't sound good," Arthur said worriedly.

Suddenly, the elevator shook violently and stopped.

"What's happening?" Dave asked.

Just then, they heard a terrible sound—the elevator cable snapping.

"Oh no!" Arthur shouted. "The elevator's going to fall!"

The elevator began free-falling, gaining speed. Dave, Buddy, and Arthur were thrown around in the cramped space.

"We need to find a way to slow the fall!" Dave shouted over the turbulence.

"Use plants!" Arthur suggested. "Quick!"

Dave struggled to aim in the violent shaking and fired several Wall-nut seeds to the elevator bottom. Wall-nuts quickly grew, forming a cushioning layer.

But it wasn't enough. The elevator was still falling at high speed, and according to the map, this elevator shaft was very deep.

"I have an idea!" Dave suddenly said. "Plant Fusion Technique!"

He quickly fired more seeds: peashooters, sunflowers, potato mines. Then using Plant Fusion Technique, he fused them all into one giant cushioning plant.

This fusion plant had the sunflower's elasticity, the peashooter's toughness, and the potato mine's explosive cushioning ability. It rapidly expanded, filling the entire bottom of the elevator shaft.

"Hold on tight!" Dave shouted.

The elevator crashed into the giant cushioning plant. Though the impact was still great, it was much better than hitting the ground directly. The cushioning plant acted like a huge airbag, absorbing most of the impact.

After several bounces, the elevator finally stopped. Dave, Buddy, and Arthur were dizzy from the impact but not seriously injured.

"Is everyone okay?" Dave asked.

"Woof woof..." Buddy weakly barked, but looked fine.

"I'm still alive," Arthur shakily stood up. "Your Plant Fusion Technique saved our lives."

They carefully exited the deformed elevator. Around them was a huge underground space filled with complex pipes and mechanical equipment. The air was filled with the smell of chemicals.

"According to the map, we should now be at the entrance to the experimental area," Dave said. "The Zombie Doctor's laboratory is not far ahead."

"But first," Arthur pointed ahead, "we need to get through that."

In front of them was a massive metal door with "BIOCHEMICAL LABORATORY: EXTREMELY DANGEROUS" written on it. Two huge robot guards stood on either side of the door, their eyes glowing red.

"Looks like our adventure isn't over yet," Dave said, checking his Magical Seed Launcher.

"Woof woof!" Buddy regained his spirit, ready for the new challenge.

"Well then," Arthur gripped his magic staff, "let's go meet the Zombie Doctor."

They walked toward the laboratory's main door, preparing to face the ultimate challenge. What awaited them behind that door? What surprises would the Zombie Doctor bring them?

All the answers would be revealed in the next chapter...
