# Chapter Eight: Vegetable War

Dave and Buddy stepped into the "Cold Storage," and a bone-chilling wind mixed with snowflakes rushed at them. The sight before them was shocking—this wasn't an ordinary cold storage room at all, but a miniature polar world covered in ice and snow. The floor, walls, and ceiling were all covered with thick layers of ice, with icicles hanging from the ceiling like sharp teeth. The air was filled with cold and dangerous atmosphere.

"My goodness," Dave pulled his thermal coat tighter, his teeth chattering from the cold. "This is much colder than I expected."

Buddy was also shivering from the cold, but his eyes remained determined, alertly observing the surroundings. In the depths of this icy world, countless blue eyes flickered in the darkness—the eyes of frozen zombies.

"Looks like we're not welcome here," Dave took out several seeds from his backpack. "Time to heat this place up!"

He quickly planted several fire peashooter seeds. In the cold environment, these plants grew slower than usual, but eventually sprouted, grew, and became plants burning with flames. The fire peashooters began firing fireballs at the frozen zombies, melting their ice layers and effectively stopping their advance.

"Well done, guys!" Dave encouraged. "Keep showing them what's what!"

Under the cover of the fire peashooters, Dave and Buddy began exploring deeper into the cold storage. They discovered this place was much larger than imagined, like a huge ice maze. Various vegetables hung on the maze walls, frozen in ice—carrots, broccoli, corn... looking like some kind of decoration.

"These vegetables... look a bit strange," Dave approached a frozen carrot, observing it carefully. "Their colors are too vibrant, and..."

Before he could finish speaking, the carrot suddenly moved, and a crack appeared in the ice layer. Then all the frozen vegetables began to shake, their ice layers cracking. What "revived" from the ice weren't ordinary vegetables, but... vegetable zombies!

"Vegetable zombies!" Dave exclaimed. "They were frozen here, and now they've been awakened by our flames!"

The Carrot Zombie waved its sharp leaves, the Broccoli Zombie pounded the ground with its hard head, and the Corn Zombie fired hard corn kernels from its mouth. Though these vegetable zombies looked comical, their attack power was not to be underestimated.

"Buddy, watch out!" Dave pulled Buddy behind a large icicle. Corn kernels shot at the icicle like bullets, making "bang bang" sounds.

"We need a new strategy," Dave said. "Fire is very effective against frozen zombies, but not so much against these vegetable zombies."

Buddy suddenly barked at Dave several times, then pointed with his paw at a seed in Dave's backpack. It was an ordinary-looking potato seed.

"Potato?" Dave asked, puzzled, but then understood Buddy's meaning. "Right! Potatoes can serve as barriers! We can use them to block the vegetable zombies' attacks!"

He immediately planted several potato seeds. These seeds grew rapidly, becoming a row of sturdy potato barriers that effectively blocked the vegetable zombies' attacks.

"Excellent, Buddy!" Dave praised. "You're a genius!"

Protected by the potato barriers, Dave began thinking about how to counterattack. He noticed that the vegetable zombies seemed particularly sensitive to certain things.

"Look, Buddy," Dave pointed at a Carrot Zombie that was gnawing on the potato barrier. "It seems to really dislike the taste of potatoes."

Buddy also noticed this, barking at the other vegetable zombies and discovering they had different reactions to different plants.

"I understand!" Dave suddenly realized. "Each vegetable zombie has a plant it dislikes! We can use this against them!"

He began strategically planting different plants: using cabbage-pults against corn zombies that liked straight-line attacks, melon-pults against groups of broccoli zombies, cherry bombs against tough carrot zombies...

The battle was exceptionally intense. Dave and Buddy worked closely with the plants, using each plant's characteristics to counter different vegetable zombies. Fire peashooters continued dealing with the constantly incoming frozen zombies, while other plants focused on the vegetable zombies.

After fierce fighting, most of the vegetable and frozen zombies were eliminated. But just when they thought they could breathe easy, the cold storage floor suddenly began shaking violently.

"Here we go again!" Dave said alertly.

The ice layer in the center of the cold storage cracked open, and a massive figure slowly rose from beneath the ice. It was a giant monster made from various vegetables fused together—the Vegetable King!

The Vegetable King stood five meters tall, its body composed of carrots, broccoli, corn, potatoes, and various other vegetables. Its arms were massive vines, its eyes were two glowing cherries, and it constantly breathed out icy cold air from its mouth.

"The Vegetable King..." Dave gasped. "This is trouble."

The Vegetable King let out a deafening roar, then swung its vine arms down at Dave and Buddy.

"Quick, dodge!" Dave pulled Buddy and quickly dodged. The vines smashed into the ground, instantly shattering the ice and leaving a huge deep crater.

"We need a big guy to deal with this big guy," Dave said. "Regular plants might just be tickling it."

Buddy suddenly barked at Dave's backpack—he had smelled a special scent. Dave opened his backpack and found a seed he had never seen before. This seed was very large, covered with strange patterns, and emanated powerful energy.

"What is this...?" Dave picked up the seed and found a small note attached that read "Giant Zombie Killer: King Chomper."

"King Chomper!" Dave was both surprised and delighted. "This is exactly what we need!"

He immediately planted the King Chomper seed in the ground. As soon as the seed touched the icy ground, it burst with powerful life force, rapidly sprouting and growing into a giant chomper. This chomper was several times larger than ordinary chompers, its petals like sharp teeth, radiating dangerous energy.

As soon as the King Chomper appeared, it immediately launched an attack on the Vegetable King. It opened its massive maw and bit down on the Vegetable King's vine arm.

The Vegetable King let out a pained roar, trying to break free, but the King Chomper's bite force was astonishing—it couldn't escape at all.

"Well done!" Dave cheered from the sidelines. "That's it, don't let go!"

The King Chomper began continuously tearing at the Vegetable King, ripping off pieces of vegetables from its body. The Vegetable King wasn't giving up either, using its other vine arm to continuously strike the King Chomper, but the King Chomper's skin was very tough and remained unaffected.

The battle entered a fierce stage. The King Chomper and Vegetable King engaged in an earth-shaking duel. Finally, under the King Chomper's fierce attacks, the Vegetable King could no longer hold on and crashed to the ground with a thunderous sound, breaking into a pile of ordinary vegetables.

"We won!" Dave jumped up excitedly and hugged Buddy tightly.

After completing its mission, the King Chomper also contentedly burped, then transformed back into a seed and flew back into Dave's backpack.

"Thank you, big guy," Dave patted his backpack. "See you next time."

They looked around and found that the ice and snow in the cold storage had begun to melt, revealing the original metal walls. At the far end of the cold storage, a new door appeared.

The door was marked "Head Chef's Office."

"Looks like we're getting closer to the zombie doctor," Dave said. "Come on, Buddy, let's see who this head chef really is."

They walked toward the door and pushed it open to find a luxurious office inside. In the center of the office sat a massive figure with its back to them. The figure wore a pristine white chef's coat and a tall chef's hat, appearing to be the master of this place.

"Welcome to my kitchen," the figure turned around, revealing his true face—a giant, menacing-looking zombie. He was the Zombie Head Chef!

The Zombie Head Chef held a huge frying pan in his hands, his eyes flickering with mad light.

"You've ruined my masterpieces," the Zombie Head Chef roared angrily. "Now I'm going to make you into my next dish!"

Dave and Buddy knew they were about to face the ultimate showdown.
