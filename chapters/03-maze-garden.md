# Chapter Three: Maze Garden

Dave and Buddy left the swamp area and arrived at a vast garden. This garden was completely different from ordinary gardens—tall green plant walls formed a complex maze structure, with flowers of various colors blooming on the walls, and the air filled with sweet floral fragrance.

"Wow!" Dave exclaimed. "This is the most spectacular garden I've ever seen!"

Buddy curiously sniffed the air, tail gently wagging, but his eyes still held wariness.

At the garden entrance stood a wooden sign that read:

> Welcome to the Sunflower Maze
> 
> Only by finding the correct path can you reach the other side
> 
> But be careful, the maze changes, and the paths move
> 
> Good luck, adventurer!

"A moving maze?" Dave scratched his head. "Sounds very challenging! But we must cross it to continue forward."

They entered the maze entrance and were immediately surrounded by tall plant walls. These walls were composed of dense vines and shrubs, over three meters high, almost impossible to climb over. The walls were covered with sunflowers whose faces turned with the direction of sunlight, their golden petals gleaming in the sunshine.

"At least these sunflowers look friendly," Dave smiled. "Not like those zombie bats and frogs."

They proceeded along the maze paths. After turning several corners, Dave began recording their route. "Left turn, then right turn, then right again..." he muttered, trying to construct a map of the maze in his mind.

But just when they reached a crossroads, something strange happened. The ground trembled slightly, then the plant walls behind them began to move, changing the shape of the paths.

"Whoa!" Dave exclaimed. "The maze is really moving!"

Buddy alertly growled low, staying close to Dave's side.

"Looks like we can't rely on memorizing the path," Dave thought. "We need another way to get through this maze."

They continued forward. Every few minutes, the maze structure would change. Sometimes walls moved, sometimes the ground rotated, taking them to completely different areas.

"This is so confusing!" Dave complained. "We might be going in circles the whole time!"

Just then, Dave noticed a strange phenomenon—the sunflowers seemed to always face the same direction, even when the angle of sunlight changed.

"Wait..." Dave stopped, carefully observing the sunflowers. "Sunflowers usually follow the sun's movement, but these sunflowers... they're all facing the same direction!"

Buddy tilted its head, seeming to notice this as well.

"I think I understand!" Dave said excitedly. "These sunflowers aren't following the sun, they're pointing the way! They must be pointing toward the maze exit!"

They began proceeding in the direction the sunflowers indicated, passing through turn after turn. Although the maze kept changing, the sunflowers' direction remained consistent.

"We're making progress!" Dave said happily. "I can feel we're getting closer and closer to the exit!"

However, just when they thought they were about to succeed, their path ahead was suddenly blocked by a particularly tall plant wall. This wall was different from the others—it had no sunflowers on it, but was covered with strange purple flowers with eye-like structures in their centers.

"This is..." Dave cautiously stepped back. "These flowers don't look very friendly."

Just then, those purple flowers suddenly "opened" their "eyes," emitting red light. Green liquid shot from the flower centers, spraying toward Dave and Buddy.

"Watch out!" Dave pulled Buddy and quickly dodged to one side. The green liquid fell to the ground with a hissing sound, corroding the surface.

"These are zombie flowers!" Dave exclaimed. "They're guarding the exit!"

More zombie flowers turned toward them, preparing to fire corrosive liquid. Dave quickly took out several peashooter seeds from his backpack and planted them in the ground.

"Grow, my friends!" Dave commanded.

The peashooters grew rapidly and began firing peas at the zombie flowers. But the zombie flowers had thick skin; ordinary peas had almost no effect on them.

"We need more powerful weapons!" Dave searched through his backpack. "Aha! Found it!"

He took out a special seed, larger than ordinary peashooter seeds and darker in color.

"This is my special variety—Fire Peashooter!" Dave placed the seed on the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a red peashooter. It began firing burning peas, each carrying flames. When these flame peas hit the zombie flowers, the flowers screamed and quickly withered.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "Fire is very effective against them!"

He planted several more Fire Peashooter seeds, and they attacked together, quickly clearing the zombie flowers blocking the way.

But just as they were about to continue forward, the entire maze suddenly shook violently.

"What's happening?" Dave looked around in panic.

The maze walls began moving at an unprecedented speed, paths constantly changing. Worse yet, those originally friendly sunflowers also began to change—red eyes appeared in the centers of their faces, and their petal edges became sharp as knives.

"The sunflowers are infected too!" Dave exclaimed. "The maze is fighting against us!"

The infected sunflowers began detaching from the walls, floating in the air, shooting sharp petals at Dave and Buddy.

"Run!" Dave pulled Buddy, running through the constantly changing maze, dodging the flying petals.

But no matter how they ran, they couldn't seem to find an exit. The maze became increasingly complex, and the infected sunflowers multiplied.

"We're trapped!" Dave panted, hiding in a temporarily safe corner. "We need a plan!"

Buddy suddenly pricked up its ears, seeming to hear something. It gently tugged at Dave's pant leg, then pointed in a direction.

"What did you hear, buddy?" Dave asked.

Buddy tugged at him again, insisting he follow. Dave decided to trust his companion and followed Buddy through the maze's complex paths.

They came to a small clearing with a particularly large sunflower in the center. Unlike the other infected sunflowers, this one still looked healthy, its golden petals gleaming.

"This is..." Dave said in surprise. "This is the Sunflower Queen!"

The Sunflower Queen turned toward them and said in a gentle voice, "Welcome, Dave and Buddy. I've been waiting for you."

"You know our names?" Dave asked in surprise.

"Of course," the Sunflower Queen smiled. "The Plant Kingdom has been following your adventures. You are a friend to plants, and now, we need your help."

"What's happening?" Dave asked. "Why have the maze and sunflowers become hostile?"

"It's the zombie virus," the Sunflower Queen said sadly. "It's infecting my people. The Zombie King sent his minions to release the virus in the maze, trying to stop you from advancing."

"The Zombie King?" Dave frowned. "He's the one who invited me to that so-called cooking competition?"

"Yes," the Sunflower Queen nodded. "He knows of your special connection with plants and sees you as a threat. He wants to lure you into a trap."

"So what should we do?" Dave asked. "We need to cross this maze, but it keeps changing, and there are infected sunflowers everywhere."

"I can help you," the Sunflower Queen said, "but first, I need you to help me purify the energy source at the maze's center. There's a special crystal there that controls the entire maze. The zombie virus has contaminated it, which is why the maze has become so chaotic."

"What do we need to do?" Dave asked.

"You need this," the Sunflower Queen took out a glowing seed from her leaves. "This is a Purification Seed—it can resist the zombie virus. Plant it next to the crystal, and it will absorb the virus and restore the crystal's purity."

Dave took the seed and carefully placed it in his backpack. "But how do we find the maze center?"

"I will guide you," the Sunflower Queen said, "but you must hurry. The virus is spreading rapidly. If all the sunflowers become infected, the maze will be permanently sealed, and you'll be trapped here."

"We'll act quickly!" Dave said firmly. "Thank you for your help, Sunflower Queen."

The Sunflower Queen nodded, then closed her eyes and concentrated. A path made of golden light appeared on the ground, pointing toward the maze depths.

"Follow this path," she said. "It will take you to the maze center. But be careful—the infected sunflowers will try to stop you."

Dave and Buddy began following the golden path. As the Sunflower Queen had warned, infected sunflowers constantly attacked them, firing sharp petals. Dave used Fire Peashooters and Snow Peas to fend off the attacks while protecting the Purification Seed.

After a difficult battle, they finally reached the maze center. There was a huge crystal here that should have been transparent, but now it was contaminated with green virus, emitting an ominous glow.

"This is it!" Dave said, taking out the Purification Seed from his backpack. "Now, let's purify this crystal!"

Just as he was about to plant the seed next to the crystal, an eerie voice suddenly rang out: "I won't let you do that, Dave!"

A tall figure emerged from behind the crystal—a zombie in a white lab coat, wearing scientist's goggles on his head, holding a strange device in his hand.

"Dr. Zomboss!" Dave exclaimed. "You're the one controlling all this!"

"Clever Dave," Dr. Zomboss sneered, "but you're too late. My virus has already infected most of the sunflowers. Soon, the entire Plant Kingdom will become the Zombie King's territory!"

"I won't let that happen!" Dave said firmly. "Buddy, protect the Purification Seed!"

Buddy immediately stood by Dave's side, growling at Dr. Zomboss.

Dr. Zomboss raised his device and fired a green beam. "My virus ray will turn all your plant friends into zombies!"

Dave quickly took out a Mirror-nut seed from his backpack and planted it in the ground. The Mirror-nut grew rapidly with a smooth, mirror-like surface that could reflect attacks.

The green beam hit the Mirror-nut and bounced back, hitting Dr. Zomboss's device. The device emitted a piercing alarm, then exploded.

"No! My virus ray!" Dr. Zomboss cried in terror.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Dave quickly planted the Purification Seed next to the crystal. The seed immediately sprouted and grew into a beautiful white flower, beginning to absorb the virus from the crystal.

The crystal gradually restored its transparency, golden light replacing the green contamination. The entire maze began to shake, but this time it was a harmonious vibration. The walls began returning to normal positions, and the infected sunflowers started recovering their health.

"No!" Dr. Zomboss screamed. "You've ruined everything!"

He turned to flee, but the maze walls moved, blocking his path.

"Looks like the maze doesn't want to let you leave," Dave said. "Your plan has failed, Dr. Zomboss."

Dr. Zomboss roared in anger, but he was trapped in the maze center, unable to escape.

After the crystal was completely purified, a bright beam of light shot from it, illuminating the entire maze. The Sunflower Queen's voice echoed in their minds: "Thank you, Dave and Buddy. You've saved the Sunflower Maze and my people. In return, I will open the path to your next destination."

The maze walls moved again, forming a direct path to the exit. At the exit, they could see a colorful building—it looked like... an amusement park?

"That's our next destination," Dave pointed in that direction. "Looks like some kind of amusement park."

Buddy nodded, seeming ready to face new challenges.

"As for you, Dr. Zomboss," Dave turned to the zombie still trapped in the maze center, "the Sunflower Queen will decide how to deal with you."

Dr. Zomboss glared at them angrily but was powerless.

Dave and Buddy left the maze center, walking along the newly opened path toward the exit. Along the way, the recovered sunflowers smiled and nodded at them in thanks.

"We did it, Buddy!" Dave said happily. "We not only crossed the maze but also saved the Sunflower Kingdom!"

Buddy proudly wagged its tail, but its eyes remained alert, seeming to know that greater challenges lay ahead.

As they walked out of the maze, the Sunflower Queen's voice echoed again: "Dave, remember, the Zombie King is more dangerous than you imagine. He has set more traps in the amusement park. Stay vigilant and trust your plant friends."

"I will, Sunflower Queen," Dave replied. "Thank you for the warning and help."

They stood at the maze exit, looking at the colorful amusement park ahead. Although it looked full of joy, Dave and Buddy knew that danger was waiting for them.

"Ready, buddy?" Dave asked Buddy.

Buddy firmly barked once, indicating readiness.

"Then let's continue our adventure!" Dave said, stepping toward the amusement park.

The sun began to set, casting long shadows of their figures. Behind them, the Sunflower Maze returned to peace, with sunflowers turning their faces toward the setting sun, as if watching this brave pair embark on their new journey.
