# Chapter One: Departure and Aerial Threat

On a sunny morning, Dave's farm was bathed in golden light. Dave, a middle-aged man with messy hair, was busy in his garage. His workbench was covered with various strange tools and plant pots, and the walls were covered with sketches of crazy inventions.

"Buddy! What do you think of this?" Dave excitedly held up a small backpack with several small flower pots connected to it. A brown dog ran out from the corner, tilting its head curiously.

Buddy was Dave's most faithful companion, a smart Border Collie who could always understand Dave's crazy ideas. It barked once, seemingly showing approval.

"This is my new invention—the Plant Battle Backpack!" Dave proudly announced. "We can put different plants in it and be ready for battle at any time!"

Just then, Dave's mailbox made a "ding" sound. He walked out of the garage and took out a strange letter from the mailbox. The envelope had no postmark, only a purple Z-shaped logo.

"Hmm, what's this?" Dave opened the envelope puzzledly and read:

> Dear Dave:
> 
> We invite you to participate in a special cooking competition! The location is at the big kitchen deep in the mysterious forest. The winner will receive a lifetime supply of delicious brains—uh, I mean delicious bread!
> 
> Looking forward to your arrival!
> 
> Dr. Z

"Buddy, this looks suspicious," Dave scratched his head, "but... free bread sounds good! And we haven't had an adventure in a long time."

Buddy didn't look certain; it whimpered softly.

"Don't worry, little guy!" Dave patted Buddy's head. "We have my plant friends to protect us!"

Dave returned to the garage and began preparing for the journey. He carefully placed several peashooter seeds into the special pockets of his backpack, then added some sunflower and wall-nut seeds.

"Remember, Buddy," Dave said while organizing his backpack, "plants are our best friends! Not only do they provide food and oxygen, but they can also protect us in dangerous moments!"

Buddy seemed to understand. It ran to the corner and brought back its own small backpack. Dave smiled and helped Buddy put it on, filling it with dog food and some small tools.

After getting ready, Dave locked the farm gate and took out the map. "According to this letter, we need to cross the sunflower fields, then go through the mysterious forest, and finally reach that so-called 'big kitchen'."

The sunlight illuminated their path forward as Dave and Buddy began their adventure journey. The sunflower fields were golden, with thousands of sunflowers swaying gently in the breeze, as if bidding them farewell.

"Look, Buddy!" Dave pointed to a particularly large sunflower. "It seems to be smiling at us!"

That sunflower indeed turned toward them, showing a brilliant smile. "Good luck, Dave and Buddy!" the sunflower said in a clear voice.

Buddy barked in surprise, but Dave laughed. "Thank you, little flower! I've always known plants can talk; it's just that very few people can hear them!"

They continued forward as the sun gradually set. When they approached the edge of the mysterious forest, the sky began to darken.

"We should find a place to spend the night in the forest," Dave said. "We'll continue our journey tomorrow."

Just as they were about to enter the forest, a strange flapping sound came from overhead.

"What's that sound?" Dave looked up, his face suddenly turning pale.

In the sky, a group of strange creatures was flying toward them. They looked like bats, but their skin was grayish-green, their eyes glowed red, and green liquid kept dripping from their mouths.

"Zombie bats!" Dave exclaimed. "Run, Buddy!"

Buddy immediately understood the danger. It nimbly jumped to Dave's side, and the two rushed toward the forest together. But the zombie bats were faster and quickly caught up with them, beginning to circle overhead.

"They're about to attack!" Dave saw several zombie bats diving down. "It's time to test my Plant Battle Backpack!"

Dave quickly took out a peashooter seed from his backpack and placed it in his palm. "Grow, my friend!" he said to the seed.

Miraculously, the seed sprouted and grew rapidly in his hand, becoming a complete peashooter plant in just a few seconds. The green stem had a round head that looked like a pea pod.

"Aim at those bats!" Dave commanded.

The peashooter nodded its "head" and began firing peas at the zombie bats in the air. "Pop! Pop! Pop!" Green peas shot out at amazing speed, hitting several zombie bats. The hit bats let out piercing screams and flew away unsteadily.

But more zombie bats swooped toward them. Buddy bravely stood in front of Dave, barking loudly at the bats, trying to scare them away.

"We need more help!" Dave took out two more peashooter seeds and quickly planted them in the ground. These plants immediately grew up and joined the battle.

Three peashooters fired together, forming a green defensive line. The zombie bats were repelled by the dense pea barrage, flying away one after another.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "We did it, Buddy!"

Buddy also wagged its tail happily, but suddenly it turned alertly toward the depths of the forest, letting out a low growl.

"What's wrong, buddy?" Dave looked in the direction of Buddy's gaze. In the dim forest, he seemed to see a pair of glowing eyes coldly watching them. But when he blinked, those eyes disappeared.

"Maybe it's just my imagination," Dave comforted himself, but there was a trace of unease in his heart. "Either way, we need to stay alert tonight."

They found a small clearing at the forest edge. Dave used tools from his backpack to set up a simple tent. The peashooters volunteered to stand guard, forming a circle to protect their camp.

Night fell. Dave lay in the tent with Buddy snuggled beside him. "Tomorrow we'll enter the mysterious forest," Dave whispered to Buddy. "I have a feeling this adventure will be more dangerous than we imagined. But as long as we're together, plus our plant friends, nothing can defeat us!"

Buddy sighed comfortably and closed its eyes. Dave also slowly fell asleep, but in his dreams, those mysterious glowing eyes appeared again, accompanied by a low voice: "Welcome to my game, Dave..."

Tomorrow, more adventures and challenges await them. But now, under the protection of their plant guards, they can rest peacefully and store energy for the journey ahead.
