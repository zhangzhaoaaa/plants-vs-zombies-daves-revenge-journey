# Chapter Ten: Oven Flames

The Zombie Head Chef stood furiously in the melted Cold World, his chef hat trembling slightly with rage. Seeing his carefully crafted ice world completely destroyed, his eyes burned with fury even hotter than the Flame Flower.

"You damned invaders!" the Zombie Head Chef roared, waving his massive frying pan. "Since freezing won't stop you, then taste the true fires of hell!"

He struck the ground heavily with his frying pan, creating a deafening metallic crash. The entire room began shaking violently, cracks appearing in the walls.

"What's he up to now?" Dave asked alertly, holding Buddy tightly.

Suddenly, the wall on the other side of the room collapsed with a thunderous crash, revealing a massive opening. From the opening surged a scorching heat wave, mixed with the smell of sulfur and the crackling sounds of flames.

"Welcome to my ultimate oven!" the Zombie Head Chef laughed maniacally. "The temperature here is hot enough to melt steel—any living being will be roasted to charcoal!"

Dave and Buddy looked toward the opening, shocked by the sight before them. It was a massive world of flames, with roaring fires everywhere. The ground was boiling lava, fire pillars shot from the walls, and burning stalactites hung from the ceiling. The entire space was like a real hell.

"This... this is like the inside of a volcano!" Dave exclaimed.

Buddy was also frightened by this scorching environment, backing up several steps as his fur curled from the high temperature.

"Go ahead, go ahead!" the Zombie Head Chef made a welcoming gesture, his face bearing an evil smile. "Let's see how long you can last in my oven! If you can come out alive, I'll acknowledge your strength!"

Dave took a deep breath, feeling the heat wave rushing at him. Although the Heart of Flame had given them power earlier, facing such an extreme environment, they still needed to be extra careful.

"We have to go in," Dave said firmly. "This might be the necessary path to the zombie doctor."

He took out two special fireproof coats from his backpack, putting one on himself and the other on Buddy. These coats were special equipment he had collected in previous adventures, capable of resisting high temperatures to some extent.

"Ready, buddy?" Dave asked.

Though nervous, Buddy bravely nodded.

They stepped into the world of flames.

As soon as they entered the oven, Dave and Buddy immediately felt unprecedented heat. Even wearing fireproof coats, they could feel their skin being roasted. The air was filled with the smell of sulfur, and each breath felt like swallowing flames.

"So hot!" Dave wiped sweat from his forehead. "We need to find a way to lower the temperature."

They carefully advanced on the lava ground, the stones beneath their feet hissing from the high temperature. Fire pillars around them shot out intermittently—they had to stay constantly alert.

"Look over there!" Dave pointed deeper into the oven. "Something seems to be moving."

In the depths of the flames, they saw strange figures. Those figures moved through the fire, seemingly completely unaffected by the high temperature.

"Those are... flame zombies?" Dave said in surprise.

Indeed, those figures were flame zombies. Their entire bodies burned with fire, their eyes emitted orange-red light, and they left burning footprints with each step. These flame zombies were more dangerous than ordinary zombies because they not only had strong attack power but could also release flame attacks.

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked alertly—he had detected danger.

The flame zombies discovered Dave and Buddy's presence and immediately charged at them. They moved quickly, traversing the lava ground as if on flat land.

"Quick, dodge!" Dave pulled Buddy behind a large rock.

The first flame zombie rushed to the rock and opened its mouth to spray flames. The flames hit the rock, which immediately turned red-hot and began melting.

"We need plant helpers!" Dave said. "But in this environment, ordinary plants can't survive at all."

He tried planting several peashooter seeds, but as soon as the seeds touched the scorching ground, they were immediately charred and couldn't sprout at all.

"This won't work," Dave said anxiously. "We need plants that can resist high temperatures."

Buddy suddenly ran to Dave's side, pointing with his paw at a blue pocket in his backpack. Dave opened it and found several blue seeds emanating a cool aura.

"These are... aquatic plant seeds!" Dave said excitedly. "Right, water conquers fire!"

These aquatic plant seeds were special seeds Dave had collected during his water adventure. They could survive in extreme environments and possessed powerful water-type attack abilities.

He immediately planted a blue seed. Surprisingly, the seed not only wasn't charred on the scorching ground but rapidly sprouted and grew. It turned out these special aquatic plant seeds had self-protection abilities, forming a water vapor protective layer around the seed.

The seed quickly grew into a unique plant—the Water Gun Lotus. This plant's roots extended deep underground, drawing from underground water sources, then transporting it through the stem to the flower. The flower was like a natural water gun, capable of spraying high-pressure water streams.

"Excellent!" Dave said excitedly. "Water Gun Lotus, cool down these flame zombies!"

The Water Gun Lotus immediately began attacking. It sprayed powerful water streams, directly hitting the nearest flame zombie. When struck by the water stream, the flame zombie's fire immediately extinguished, it let out a painful shriek, then collapsed to the ground as a pile of ash.

"It works!" Dave cheered. "Keep attacking!"

He planted several more aquatic plant seeds, and soon had a row of Water Gun Lotuses blooming in the oven. They continuously sprayed water streams, effectively suppressing the flame zombies' advance.

But there were many flame zombies, and they began adopting new tactics. Some flame zombies gathered together, forming a huge fireball, then rolled toward Dave and Buddy.

"Watch out!" Dave pulled Buddy and quickly dodged. Where the fireball rolled, even rocks were melted.

"We need more powerful aquatic plants!" Dave said. "Buddy, do you notice anything else?"

Buddy carefully observed the surrounding environment and suddenly discovered a huge lava pool in the center of the oven. In the center of the lava pool was a small island with something glowing on it.

"Woof woof!" Buddy pointed toward the small island.

Dave looked in the direction Buddy indicated and indeed saw a glowing object on the island. The object was surrounded by flames, but its outline was still visible—it was a huge blue seed!

"What kind of seed is that?" Dave asked curiously. "It looks very special."

Just then, more flame zombies swarmed from all directions. They were not only numerous but began displaying stronger abilities. Some flame zombies could spray fireballs, some could create fire walls, and some could even summon fire dragons.

"The situation is getting worse," Dave said. "We have to find a way to reach that island—that seed might be our key!"

But the path to the island was blocked by boiling lava, and flame zombies patrolled the airspace above the lava pool.

Dave had a sudden inspiration and thought of a plan.

"Buddy, do you see those rocks?" Dave pointed to several protruding rocks in the lava pool. "We can use them as stepping stones!"

He commanded the Water Gun Lotuses to concentrate their attacks on those rocks, using water streams to lower their temperature. Soon, the rocks changed from red-hot to black, cooling to a bearable temperature.

"Now!" Dave picked up Buddy and began jumping between the rocks.

Their movement attracted the flame zombies' attention, and countless fireballs flew at them. Dave nimbly dodged the attacks while commanding the Water Gun Lotuses to provide cover.

After thrilling jumps, they finally reached the small island. This island was smaller than they had imagined, only a few square meters, but the seed on it radiated powerful energy.

This seed was more special than any seed Dave had ever seen. It was completely blue, like a huge sapphire, with complex water wave patterns on its surface, radiating cool light. Most amazingly, even in this scorching environment, the seed had formed a cool water vapor shield around it.

Beside the seed was a stone plaque carved with ancient text. Dave carefully made out the content:

"Heart of Ocean—legendary ultimate water-type plant seed. Can summon the power of the ocean to extinguish all flames, but only pure hearts can master its power."

"Heart of Ocean!" Dave said excitedly. "This is exactly what we need!"

He carefully picked up the seed, which felt cool as water in his hands, giving him unprecedented tranquility.

"Now, let's go back and give those flame zombies a surprise!" Dave said.

But just then, the lava pool began boiling violently, and a massive figure rose from it—a giant monster made of lava and flames, the Flame King!

The Flame King stood ten meters tall, its entire body composed of boiling lava, its eyes were two burning flames, and it continuously spewed magma from its mouth. As soon as it appeared, the entire oven's temperature immediately rose several times over.

"The Flame King..." Dave gasped. "This is trouble."

The Flame King let out a deafening roar, then shot massive fireballs at the small island.

"Quick, dodge!" Dave held Buddy and quickly dodged. The fireball hit the edge of the island, instantly melting the rock.

"We're trapped here!" Dave said. "We must use the Heart of Ocean!"

He planted the Heart of Ocean seed in the center of the small island. As soon as the seed touched the ground, it burst with amazing energy. The entire oven began shaking, and water vapor began filling the air.

What grew from the seed wasn't a plant, but a massive water tornado. This water tornado was twenty meters tall, shaped like an inverted funnel, radiating deep blue light. Its power was so strong that even the lava began cooling and solidifying.

"Ocean Storm!" Dave marveled.

As soon as the Ocean Storm appeared, the entire oven's temperature immediately dropped. The flame zombies began extinguishing in this powerful water vapor, they retreated in terror, but it was too late.

The Ocean Storm began rotating, releasing countless water bullets. Each water bullet accurately hit a flame zombie, instantly extinguishing them. In less than a few minutes, all the flame zombies had disappeared, leaving only ash on the ground.

The Flame King also began cooling under the Ocean Storm's attack. Its lava body gradually solidified, and its flame eyes began dimming. Finally, it let out an unwilling roar, then shattered into countless pieces of cooled rock, sinking to the bottom of the lava pool.

The lava in the oven also began cooling and solidifying under the Ocean Storm's influence, revealing the original metal floor. It turned out this had originally been a huge industrial furnace, just transformed into a flame world by the Zombie Head Chef.

"We succeeded again!" Dave excitedly lifted Buddy. "The Heart of Ocean is so powerful!"

After completing its mission, the Ocean Storm gradually shrank, finally returning to seed form and flying back into Dave's backpack. But the coolness it left behind still permeated the oven.

Just then, they heard angry roars behind them. Looking back, they saw the Zombie Head Chef charging in furiously.

"Impossible! Impossible!" the Zombie Head Chef roared madly. "How could my oven be destroyed by you! This was my most prized masterpiece!"

Seeing the ash everywhere and the completely changed environment, the fury in his eyes nearly burst forth.

"You damned invaders!" the Zombie Head Chef raised his frying pan. "I'll personally fry you into meat patties with this pan!"

Dave and Buddy knew the final showdown was about to begin. But they were no longer afraid, because they possessed the dual power of the Heart of Flame and Heart of Ocean.

"Come on, Zombie Head Chef!" Dave said bravely. "Let's have a real culinary duel!"

In the cooled oven, a decisive battle was about to unfold. The Zombie Head Chef waved his massive frying pan, while Dave prepared his plant army.

This would be the ultimate showdown of fire and water, plants and zombies...
