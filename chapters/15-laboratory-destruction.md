# Chapter Fifteen: Laboratory Destruction

After defeating the robot guards, Dave, Buddy, and Arthur entered the biochemical laboratory. The sight before them was both fascinating and terrifying—rows of glass containers filled with strange experiments, mutated plants growing in unnatural colors, and complex machinery humming with ominous energy.

"This is where the Zombie Doctor conducts his experiments," Arthur said grimly. "These mutated plants... they're all corrupted by dark magic."

Dave observed the twisted plant specimens. Some had multiple heads, others glowed with sickly light, and many seemed to writhe with malevolent life even in their containers.

"We need to free them," Dave said, his heart filled with compassion. "They didn't choose to become like this."

Using the purification techniques they had learned, Dave and Arthur began methodically cleansing the corrupted plants. With each purification, the plants returned to their natural forms—beautiful flowers bloomed, healthy leaves unfurled, and the laboratory began to fill with the fresh scent of nature.

"Woof woof!" Buddy barked excitedly as he discovered something important—a massive door at the far end of the laboratory marked "Inner Sanctum."

"That must be where the Zombie Doctor is," Dave said, steeling himself for the final confrontation.

As they prepared to enter, the laboratory began shaking violently. Alarms blared, and a familiar evil laugh echoed through the speakers.

"So, you've finally made it this far," the Zombie Doctor's voice boomed. "But you're too late! My ultimate creation is nearly complete!"

The door to the Inner Sanctum burst open, revealing their greatest challenge yet.
