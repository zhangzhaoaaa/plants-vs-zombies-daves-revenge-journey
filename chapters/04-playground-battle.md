# Chapter Four: Playground Battle

Dave and Buddy left the Sunflower Maze and stood before the entrance of a colorful amusement park. A huge colorful archway displayed a flashing neon sign: "Zombie Fun Park," but the "Fun" part of the sign was broken, leaving only "Zombie Park" flickering in the darkness, looking particularly ominous.

"This place doesn't look fun at all," Dave frowned. "But we must cross it to reach the mysterious kitchen."

Buddy alertly sniffed the air, growling softly, clearly wary of this place.

The amusement park was empty, but strangely, all the rides were operating—the carousel slowly turned, roller coaster cars shuttled along tracks, and even the cotton candy machine was automatically making pink cotton candy. But there was no laughter, no crowds, only the creaking sounds of machinery and eerie circus music drifting from speakers.

"This is too strange," Dave whispered. "An amusement park with no visitors?"

They carefully entered the park, Dave gripping his backpack straps tightly, ready to take out plant seeds at any moment to deal with danger.

"According to the map, we need to cross this amusement park to reach the dock on the other side," Dave checked the map in his hand. "It looks like the fastest route is through the central plaza."

They proceeded along the main path, flanked by various rides and snack stands. Though empty, all the lights were on and music was playing, as if the park was ready to welcome visitors at any moment.

"This place gives me a bad feeling, Buddy," Dave said. "Stay alert."

Just then, a cheerful voice suddenly rang out from the speakers:

"Welcome to Zombie Fun Park! I'm your host—Clown Zombie Jack! Today we have special guests: Dave and his dog Buddy! Let's prepare some special games for them, shall we?"

Dave and Buddy looked around alertly but couldn't see the source of the voice.

"They know our names!" Dave said in surprise.

"Of course, Dave!" Clown Zombie Jack's voice rang out again. "We've been waiting for you! The Zombie King is very interested in you. But before you meet him, you must pass my games! First game—balloon shooting!"

Suddenly, hundreds of colorful balloons flew out from various corners of the amusement park, floating toward Dave and Buddy. These balloons looked ordinary, but as they approached, Dave noticed each balloon had a zombie face painted on it.

"Be careful, Buddy! These aren't ordinary balloons!" Dave warned.

Sure enough, when the first balloon floated overhead, it suddenly exploded, releasing a cloud of green gas. The gas formed the shape of a small zombie, then fell to the ground and became a mini zombie!

"Zombie balloons!" Dave exclaimed. "They turn into zombies!"

More balloons floated over, continuously exploding and forming more and more mini zombies. Though these small zombies were only a quarter the size of normal zombies, they were numerous and surprisingly fast.

"We need plant helpers!" Dave quickly took out several peashooter seeds from his backpack and planted them in the surrounding ground.

The peashooters grew rapidly and began firing peas at the mini zombies. But the mini zombies were too small and fast; most of the peas missed them.

"They're too small!" Dave said worriedly. "We need plants that can cover a larger area!"

He took out a new seed from his backpack—it was purple and larger than ordinary seeds.

"This is my newest cultivated variety—Puff-shroom!" Dave placed the seed on the ground. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a purple mushroom. It had a nozzle-like structure on top that began spraying purple spore clouds in all directions. These spore clouds covered a large area, and when mini zombies came into contact with the spore clouds, their movements noticeably slowed.

"Excellent!" Dave cheered. "The spore clouds can slow them down!"

He planted several more Puff-shroom seeds, forming a defensive circle. The peashooters and Puff-shrooms worked together, beginning to effectively eliminate the mini zombies.

But Clown Zombie Jack's voice rang out again: "Oh, looks like you passed the first round! But don't celebrate too early—next is the carousel challenge!"

The carousel in the central plaza suddenly accelerated, and the animals on it—horses, lions, tigers—all turned into zombie forms, jumped off the carousel, and charged toward Dave and Buddy.

"Zombie animals!" Dave exclaimed. "This is crazy!"

These zombie animals were stronger than the mini zombies; ordinary peashooters had almost no effect on them. A zombie lion charged at Dave. Buddy bravely jumped forward, barking loudly at the zombie lion, trying to scare it away.

"Buddy, be careful!" Dave shouted in concern.

The zombie lion wasn't scared away but became even angrier, preparing to pounce on Buddy. At this critical moment, Dave took out a special seed from his backpack—it was red with black stripes.

"Cherry Bomb!" Dave quickly planted the seed in front of the zombie lion. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a huge red cherry with an angry face. When the zombie lion approached, the Cherry Bomb suddenly swelled, then—BOOM! It exploded, creating a powerful shockwave that blew away the zombie lion and several surrounding zombie animals.

"Fantastic!" Dave cheered. "Cherry Bombs are the best choice for dealing with these strong zombies!"

He planted several more Cherry Bomb seeds, strategically placing them in the paths of the zombie animals. Whenever zombie animals approached, the Cherry Bombs would explode, clearing large areas of enemies.

"No! My lovely zombie animals!" Clown Zombie Jack's voice sounded annoyed. "Alright, looks like you need a more exciting game—roller coaster adventure!"

The amusement park's roller coaster suddenly changed track direction, heading straight toward Dave and Buddy's position. The cars were filled with various zombies—tourist zombies wearing Hawaiian shirts, photographer zombies with cameras, even child zombies eating ice cream.

"They're going to crash into us!" Dave cried in terror. "We need to stop that roller coaster!"

He quickly took out a new seed from his backpack—it was brown and looked like a nut.

"Wall-nut!" Dave planted the seed in front of the roller coaster track. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a huge nut, taller than a person. Its surface was hard as iron, firmly blocking the track.

The roller coaster crashed into the Wall-nut at amazing speed with a tremendous impact sound. The Wall-nut didn't budge, while the roller coaster was severely deformed, cars derailed, and zombies were thrown from the cars, scattered on the ground.

"So dangerous!" Dave wiped the sweat from his forehead. "But the Wall-nut saved us!"

The thrown zombies quickly got up and charged toward Dave and Buddy. Dave quickly planted more Cherry Bombs and peashooters, forming a defensive line.

"You're too cunning!" Clown Zombie Jack's voice sounded even more annoyed. "It's time for you to witness my true power!"

The ground in the central plaza suddenly opened, and a huge stage rose up. On the stage stood a tall zombie wearing a colorful clown costume, his face painted with exaggerated clown makeup, but his skin was grayish-green and his eyes glowed red.

"Welcome to the ultimate show!" Clown Zombie Jack spread his arms wide. "I, Jack, will personally send you to meet the Zombie King!"

He pulled out several colorful balls from his pocket and threw them into the air. These balls exploded in the air, releasing more mini zombies and zombie balloons.

"We're surrounded!" Dave said worriedly, looking at the increasing number of zombies around them.

Buddy pressed nervously against Dave's leg, growling softly, ready to protect his master at any moment.

"We need a breakthrough!" Dave looked around, searching for an escape route.

Just then, he noticed the control panel behind Clown Zombie Jack—there was a big red button labeled "Emergency Stop."

"Buddy, I have a plan," Dave whispered to Buddy. "We need to distract the clown, then press that red button."

Buddy seemed to understand Dave's meaning and nodded.

Dave quickly took out all remaining Cherry Bomb seeds from his backpack and planted them all at once, forming a circle.

"Ready, Buddy?" Dave asked. "When I count to three, all the Cherry Bombs will explode, creating huge smoke clouds. Under cover of the smoke, you rush to the control panel and press the red button."

Buddy firmly barked once, indicating readiness.

"One, two, three!" Dave shouted.

All the Cherry Bombs exploded simultaneously, creating tremendous explosion sounds and dense smoke that covered the entire central plaza. In the chaos, Buddy nimbly weaved through the zombie horde and rushed toward the control panel.

"What?" Clown Zombie Jack looked around in confusion. "I can't see! What kind of trick is this?"

Taking this opportunity, Dave also charged toward Clown Zombie Jack, taking out the last seed from his backpack—a particularly large, golden seed.

"This is my most precious seed—Golden Cherry Bomb!" Dave planted the seed at Clown Zombie Jack's feet. "Grow, my friend!"

The seed quickly sprouted and grew into a huge golden cherry, three times larger than ordinary Cherry Bombs.

"What?" Clown Zombie Jack looked down and saw the Golden Cherry Bomb, terror appearing on his face. "No!"

At the same time, Buddy successfully jumped onto the control panel and pressed the red button with his paw.

The entire amusement park suddenly stopped operating—all lights went out, music stopped, machines ceased functioning. In this moment of silence, the Golden Cherry Bomb exploded, creating an unprecedented powerful shockwave that blew away Clown Zombie Jack and all surrounding zombies.

"Fantastic, Buddy!" Dave cheered. "We did it!"

When the smoke cleared, they saw Clown Zombie Jack blown to pieces, parts scattered everywhere. He wasn't a real zombie after all, but a robot!

"A robot?" Dave said in surprise, picking up a piece of debris to examine it. "This is another trick of the Zombie King!"

The amusement park returned to calm, and all the zombies disappeared. Dave and Buddy could finally catch their breath.

"We successfully crossed the amusement park," Dave said, pointing toward the distant exit. "Look, there's the dock! We're getting closer and closer to the mysterious kitchen!"

Buddy wagged his tail tiredly but proudly, following Dave toward the dock.

As they left the amusement park, Dave glanced back at this strange place. In the darkness, he seemed to see a tall figure standing at the highest point of the amusement park, coldly watching them. But when he blinked, the figure disappeared.

"Probably just my imagination," Dave comforted himself, but there was a trace of unease in his heart. "Either way, we must keep moving forward. Next stop—water adventure!"

The sun had set and night had fallen. Under the moonlight, the dock's outline was faintly visible, with several strange boats floating on the water, waiting for their arrival.

Dave and Buddy walked toward the dock, ready to face the next challenge. But what they didn't know was that underwater, countless pairs of red eyes were watching them, waiting for the right moment to attack...
